    "My first pair of gloves arrived different colors and not in great condition. I contacted customer service and literally two days later I had a brand new pair and a refund. The new gloves look great, feel great, and I can't wait to really try them out. Thank you for the great customer service!!",
    "We loved the color choices. Order the mint, lavender, and coral for me and my daughters. So far we have only used the used one in class and as expected they are stiffer than those. The only thang that I am kind of sad about is that my mint bag came broke. The girls bags are intact and ready to go.",
    "I am new to kickboxing, so I have no idea how these compare to other gloves. That said, I've had a lovely experience. They haven't discolored despite my wiping tons of sweat along the sides, they are very comfortable, and they fit my hands well. Other gloves (not designed for women's hands) that I had borrowed tended to seem a bit too roomy, almost like when you wear a shoe that is meant for wide feet. These ones are perfectly fitted without being snug or uncomfortable. And the color is lovely! I've received lots of compliments, including from more veteran kickboxers.",
    "I love these so much \ud83e\udd4a\u2764\ufe0f. When I use them to train my wrist is protected and it doesn\u2019t cause injury. I love the way these are built and how the square front is.",
    "Love the overall feel and quality of these gloves. I\u2019m excited to see how these hold up over time from a durability and odor resistance standpoint. Cheers!",
    "",
    "Started a boxing type of excersise class. Needed gloves & wraps. These work great. Love the color. Different than the typical red gloves.",
    "I bought this for my Rock Steady Boxing class. As a person with Parkinson\u2019s it was really important to me to find a great fitting glove!! These gloves are perfect!! They fit great, pretty easy to get on and off and they have great padding(I can punch hard)lol. These are not my first pair of women\u2019s boxing gloves. I returned the last brand. I have small hands and the 14oz. fit me great. I will definitely be buying them again in another color!! Love the gloves!! Thank you Sanabul for making a great quality woman\u2019s boxing glove!!!\u2764\ufe0f",
    "I purchased these after using generic gloves for years (the ones you get with your membership at kickboxing gyms) and Everlast. I noticed that the instructor had these gloves, so I figured they must be legit. These seem bulkier than my Everlast, but then again those seemed strangely small. Also, I got the 14 oz for a better workout, whereas my previous pairs were 12, so that could be why, too. I can tell these are good quality and will hold up nicely. For reference, I use them for kickboxing workout classes, not actual boxing. *I will update on durability after a few months.* I like these enough to recommend the brand to my mom, who needed new gloves because her Everlast were falling apart, too. She ordered a different color and they are so cute, I\u2019m jelly. I particularly like that these come in so many cute colors.",
    "I\u2019ve been in kickboxing classes and teaching for over a decade, I wanted to try a different brand and gave these a try. They were great for the first 3 months, but the gel/foam is already thinning considerably and they have a tighter fit than I prefer. I\u2019m petite so it\u2019s surprising. Disappointed I\u2019m not going to get my usual 12-18 months out of these gloves for the cost. Probably a decent choice for beginners.",
