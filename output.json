    "camera": [
      "The Nikon Coolpix P1000 is an excellent point and shoot camera as long you know its limitations.",
      "The camera uses a tiny sensor, a smartphone sensor, so low light is the first challenge already.",
      "Shooting handheld with this camera is doable as long you keep your zoom range within a reasonable range.",
      "Not sure because I am so used to carrying heavy camera gear that having this Coolpix P1000, to me, is very light.",
      "It might feel heavy for others not used to carrying heavy camera gear.",
      "But for me, this camera is light as \"feather\" so to speak, in relation to my heavy gear.",
      "After you use this camera on several trips and hikes, your body will eventually adjust to the weight.",
      "I know this is a point and shoot camera but if you really want to get the best out of this camera, the user needs to learn other forms of shooting styles, particularly using the different shooting modes- M, A, S. Trust me.",
      "User needs to read the full manual just in case they notice a function doesn't work; chances are the functionality isn't available at that moment because the camera locked you out because of a setting you made.",
      "The Quick manual that came with the camera is just a quick reference guide.",
      "This full manual will tell you EVERYTHING that you need to know about the camera.",
      "Since you've already invested $1000 on a camera, there's no reason for you to go cheap on the battery.",
      "I strongly suggest getting a UV lens filter for this camera.",
      "Never ever strap a camera around your neck.",
      "I really think neck straps should not be used for cameras of this size as this causes neck strain.",
      "Just make sure the camera is well-tethered to you when attaching this camera to a tripod.",
      "I recommend this camera to those looking for an all in one camera.",
      "The camera is just a device, majority of the work will have to come from the user for this camera to come up with great images.",
      "Highly recommended camera.",
      "This is clearly the best birding camera I have ever owned, including a Canon 7D DSLR camera with a 400mm zoom lens.",
      "I have found that if I turn the display inward (facing into the back of the camera) it will stay off.",
      "The viewfinder also stays off unless I lift the camera to my face to view it.",
      "So, I can leave the camera turned on while I take nature walks without running down the battery as fast.",
      "Original review:\nThe best part about this camera is the electronic viewfinder.",
      "It is bright and detailed enough to make the camera like a hand-held image-stabilized spotting scope with automatic focus and brightness adjustment.",
      "in human vision is better than in the camera.",
      "So, we can expect that future super-zoom cameras will improve dramatically as the image processing becomes faster and more sophisticated.",
      "So this is a quick overview of how this camera will compare against the P900 for WILDLIFE photography.",
      "I see reviews in the city like what the heck guys this camera is not the strongest in street photography probably the worse since it is So HUGE!!!",
      "There were some thing that scared me off from the camera.",
      "Part of me ordering the camera is there is so little info on how it works in wildlife for photography.",
      "Build Quality--> Way better hands down,\n\nNIkon has made this for the WILDLIFE Hardcore... You can feel the direction they improved this camera.",
      "They did a great job but my only concern is that it is made for TOO Serious of Photographers and will be considered a niche camera do to its size.",
      "My self serving needs are I want more cameras like this versus my DSLR gear.",
      "I think the reviews on this camera have been horrible so far.",
      "They concentrate on too many things as a general use camera.",
      "I was fortunate to buy a like-new camera from Japan.",
      "This is *not* an everyday camera, it's big and heavy, but I've taken photos of structures 11 miles away.",
      "I'm certainly glad I purchased this niche camera, especially at a used price and with Amazon's return policy.",
      "The camera operated flawlessly as it should.",
      "Camera, zoom control, shutter would not work and only way to get camera operating again is to turn power off and on.",
      "I have over 5K+ exposures on the camera and has worked flawlessly until now.",
      "At first it seemed a bit backwards in design but after using the camera I found the extra size and weight to help keep the camera steady on the longer zoom shots.",
      "The camera got alot of attention and most inquiries were positive once they got it in their hands.",
      "If Nikon continues with cameras like the P1000, why would anyone need a DSLR?",
      "Let me state that I am an internationally published professional photographer and was an official contributor for Playboy SE Inc. for 5 years, so needless to say I have vast experience with cameras and DSLR\u2019s of all shapes and sizes.",
      "I bought a P900 when it came out and was blown away at the capabilities of that camera.",
      "I never in a million years could imagine myself with a consumer brand Nikon CoolPix camera in my hand, but then again the CoolPix P900 did what none of my Professional Brand camera gear could do.",
      "It\u2019s body is much bigger and sturdier than any other camera in the CoolPix line.",
      "It looks, feels, and pretty much performs like a higher end D750, except it has all the features that enable less experienced photographers take great pictures... things like scene mode, time lapses, it\u2019s so user friendly but has all the manual functions a camera snob like me demands.",
      "Kind of like the iPhone did for photography, this camera opens the impossible up for everyone now.",
      "I have been wanting a high zoom camera for a long time.",
      "You can\u2019t buy an equivalent lens for anything close to the price of this camera.",
      "You can take good shots at high zoom and not have camera shake.",
      "Even though this camera is a little bulky, it is far lighter than my DSLR and the lenses.",
      "Cons\n\u2022 Sensor is too small for this camera.",
      "\u2022 No protection from rain\n\u2022 You have to wait for the camera to zoom.",
      "This is typical of this camera and demonstrates the poor quality typical of full zoom.",
      "I bought this camera specifically for it's long focal-length video capability and had my doubts about what it could actually do.",
      "After a month or so of use I have to say the camera is radically good.",
      "All the vehicles -- cars, trucks, bicycles, and pedestrians -- are stacked up between the camera and the on-ramp and they're all moving under their own power as well as in the boiling air.",
      "The P1000 does not have many of the controls or features found on professional video cameras but it has enough that I'm happy with it.",
      "It works for me as an extreme-zoom lens with a fairly simple video camera attached.",
      "Pictures are from my P900, I expect better from my new P1000\nI see here and on You Tube reviewers talking about the weight of the camera, If you're use to a camera this big or heavy, you're going to keep on it a tripod.. that's a waste of a great camera.",
      "Two years ago before I got the P900 I used a Canon D5 Mark II and with a 24-105 len it was just as heavy and that was my go to camera for weddings, portraits, for my special events, sporting (NHRA drag racing) NFL football and college football games, nature, landscapes and many places where I can't use a tripod.",
      "So far I like this camera, I think many camera users are good photographers, they could be great if they stay away from the auto setting much as possible with a good camera as the P1000, I still plan to use my P900 when it calls for it, but I love shooting in raw which you can't with the P900.",
      "And a tip to getting great zoom photographs is using a tripod when shooting between 500 mm to 3000 mm, you're find that the photographs will be much clearer using the proper settings on the camera, yes the camera has a great stabilization to help .",
      "The camera itself is awesome.",
      "I just got home from the UPS store where I returned my new camera.",
      "I was smart enough to know that I would need a monopod to help me stabilize the camera, but it wasn't enough.",
      "Just fyi I have been taking photos for 59 years so I know a little about working a camera.",
      "I just was disappointed in this camera because it is too large and I don't want to always have to have a tripod or monopod when I'm shooting.",
      "It's not a bad camera.",
      "By the way, that was really ignorant to say that I'm too old and weak for a big boy camera.",
      "Would I be entitled to the opinion that this camera does not work for me?",
      "I would definitely prefer a seal on the box, better wrapping of the actual camera, and the manuals in plastic as they were rattling around in the box and made it sound like something was broken before I opened it.",
      "I started taking pictures around 1970 with a Kodak Instamatic camera, which I still own, using 126 cartridge films.",
      "I now own several cameras; most of them are Nikon cameras.",
      "Every camera I own has its pros and cons.",
      "I didn't buy this camera thinking I would get the same quality images I get from my Nikon D750 with a Nikon AF-S FX NIKKOR 24-70mm f/2.8E ED Vibration Reduction Zoom Lens.",
      "I bought the Nikon P1000 for all the pleasure I get from using it, sometimes I get good images and sometimes bad ones, as with most any camera.",
      "Yes, it\u2019s a big camera for a point and shoot but when its gets heavy I put it down.",
      "So far no problems with camera.",
      "This camera was purchased for fun and the interesting photos you can get with it.",
      "This is a far better camera overall than the P900.",
      "(Original review)\nI am really impressed with\nthis camera.",
      "I'm finding I have better control with this size camera.",
      "No fault to the camera however.",
      "When I use the camera on burst mode all the images come out in perfect Focus.",
      "I like the control ring around the lens of the camera.",
      "I think this is a fantastic and easy camera for someone who is amateur like myself and works very well on automatic mode 4 nearly all scenes.",
      "I certainly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for great quality and and extremely large Zoom range.",
      "I have own many Nikon cameras (and even some Canons) including the D850.",
      "This has been solved by a camera which costs a third of any of these telephoto lenses which would mount on my D850.",
      "The camera has the feel of DSLR but has a reach way beyond anything I have ever used before.",
      "I am amazed this camera is not priced more.",
      "Although this might not be the easiest camera to carry around during a trip, it will definitely be the best camera especially if you are planning on photographing landscape, animals or even sporting events, this is a camera which will give you some of the best photos you have ever taken.",
      "Otherwise this camera can easily be used handheld if you can handle the weight of a DSLR.",
      "I consider this camera one of the best buys I have made in photography over the last five years.",
      "This camera allows me to photograph objects I only dreamed about in the past since they were beyond the reach of my equipment/location.",
      "I now carry this camera with me instead of a $3000 to $4000 telephoto lens which does not even come close to this 3000 mm P1000 camera.",
      "If I need a zoom, I pull out this camera and keep a standard lens on my D850.",
      "Outstanding camera from its sensor to its lens.",
      "Can not imagine photography without this camera.",
      "I was so excited to read reviews on this camera and the zoom capabilities listed.",
      "I have a canon camera and have no issues with connecting to wifi to download pictures.",
      "One other issue is the camera gets out of focus too easily.",
      "So much time still learn on this camera but I love everything so far!",
      "I've had this camera for two days now and have worked thru the 175-page manual, so I feel safe posting some initial thoughts.",
      "(The photos I uploaded are 24, 1000, 2000, and 3000 mm, -- straight out of the camera.",
      "I'm sure my DH-4 will remain my primary camera, but this Nikon seems to fulfill its main purpose quite well.",
      "Many have complained of this camera being heavy.",
      "Still, I have taken excellent photos with other cameras that were the same.",
      "Everyone has their own idea of what is ideal in a camera and lens.",
      "One camera covers all situations.",
      "Hand held, I attach pictures of a heron at 1000mm, a cormorant swimming at 2000mm and at 3000mm, all within about 200 feet of the camera.",
      "So this is a very capable camera, both on a tripod and, owing to good image stabilization, hand held.",
      "Average review was 4.4 stars but several users warned that these batteries don't last all that long, so I'm going to keep the OEM battery in my camera bag and use the cheapies and see how well they do.",
      "To protect the camera I bought an Amazon basics medium size camera bag which fits well, though would not protect against major impacts.",
      "These pictures are not the highest possible resolution for the camera.",
      "Shoot raw and the lower resolution of the camera is not an issue for me.",
      "The lens itself, autofocus, features of the camera, etc., are really fun!",
      "Otherwise, out of the box, charging is only while in the camera.",
      "I would buy this camera again.",
      "i got this camera last year, almost as an impulse buy - though i did watch a bunch of videos talking about it.",
      "i like this camera a lot, i have taken literally thousands of photos with it.",
      "its a professional looking point-n-shoot camera, and it does exactly what it says on the box.",
      "i also like to use it when taking photos of birds - i never have to get too close, but i find that the camera is a bit slow when the animals are moving.",
      "i like the camera, and ive had fun with it taking all my photos.",
      "Also an excellent camera.",
      "If Nikon releases an update to this camera I will buy it immediately.",
      "Persons will have trouble holding the camera still enough at max.",
      "Wonderful feel when holding this slightly larger than normal camera.",
      "If you own a P900, you might want to think twice about this camera, however.",
      "If you did not get a P900 because RAW was not included as part of that camera, this one has RAW for you purists.",
      "It is not an \"everything for every Photographer\" camera, but then, what camera is??",
      "If you do a lot of Nature Photography, or just live where you get to see a lot of nature out your back door, this is the camera for you!!!",
      "You will get those long distance pics of Mother Nature at her best that you would miss with another camera.",
      "And while I do wish it had better battery life, when out in Nature, that little failing is not enough to dampen my enthusiasm for this camera.",
      "I do recommend this camera.",
      "This is not a bad camera, true the pictures aren't all that good (16 MP ) at max zoom the photos are blurry.",
      "You won't find a better video camera unless you buy a professional camera ( thousands of $$$).",
      "I had to return mine because after I spent all that money, I got an open box ( or returned) camera.",
      "So if you are looking for a good video camera, this is it ( pictures so, so )...",
      "This is a great camera if you are taking a lot of variety of pictures from closeups of flowers, to family shots, to scenes and birds and animals and don\u2019t want to have to change lenses.",
      "I have a smaller camera I take places when I don\u2019t need the super zoom as it is quite bulky and heavy.",
      "This is my first take on the Nikon Coolpix P1000 camera.",
      "As with all new cameras there's a learning curve but this one seems less than others.",
      "For the moonshot I used a porch post to lean against to stabilize the camera.",
      "CONS: The camera didn't come with a separate wall charger.",
      "You have to charge the battery in the camera itself with the charger adapter kit provided.",
      "The battery is removeable and sits next to the SD card slot on the bottom of the camera.",
      "I am not sure someone with small hands could hold this camera comfortably and would most likely have to resort to a monopod or tripod.",
      "You can't put a price on the fun you'll have with this great camera..",
      "If you are looking into this camera it is probably because of the 3000mm built-in zoom and macro capability.",
      "I have used this camera on a couple of big trips-The Galapagos Islands and a recent Italy & Greece trip.",
      "The weight is tolerable for a full day of shooting if you support the camera when not taking pictures or else use a shoulder strap.",
      "The photos I have attached of the Hephaestus Temple that I shot while descending the Acropolis, are a good example of this cameras zoom capability on a perfect day.",
      "I find this camera to be a great solution for people who don't want to carry a lot of equipment.",
      "I bought my last Nikon camera ten years ago.",
      "The next morning, if you want to take close-up pictures of your flowers, you'll use this camera in macro mode at 1 centimeter away.",
      "This is a \"bridge camera;\" it delivers superb pictures up close, and it delivers mind-blowing moon pictures, all without stopping to change lenses.",
      ": I also record training videos with this camera.",
      "I added an Audio-Technica shotgun mike to the accessory shoe on the camera, to record my granddaughter's orchestra concerts.",
      "I have to say that I really wanted to like this camera, I really did.",
      "I had the P900 before and I think it was a better camera.",
      "The main reasons I wanted this camera was the extra 1000 mm of zoom and the hot shoe, but the P900 just took better pictures."
    ],
    "use": [
      "The camera uses a tiny sensor, a smartphone sensor, so low light is the first challenge already.",
      "Remember though, when you push 3000mm even with a tripod, the quality of the image degrades because of the distance and size of the subject.",
      "This is a fact and it must be accepted by the user because it's just how the technology was built into this system, and the reality that 3000mm will start picking up heat shimmers, wind etc start showing up.",
      "Not sure because I am so used to carrying heavy camera gear that having this Coolpix P1000, to me, is very light.",
      "It might feel heavy for others not used to carrying heavy camera gear.",
      "After you use this camera on several trips and hikes, your body will eventually adjust to the weight.",
      "I know this is a point and shoot camera but if you really want to get the best out of this camera, the user needs to learn other forms of shooting styles, particularly using the different shooting modes- M, A, S. Trust me.",
      "User needs to read the full manual just in case they notice a function doesn't work; chances are the functionality isn't available at that moment because the camera locked you out because of a setting you made.",
      "What about battery use?",
      "Please please use Nikon batteries.",
      "Do not use third-party batteries.",
      "Some ways to save battery power is to not use the Monitor all the time.",
      "I really think neck straps should not be used for cameras of this size as this causes neck strain.",
      "The camera is just a device, majority of the work will have to come from the user for this camera to come up with great images.",
      "Wildlife around my house.",
      "I still consider this a substantial upgrade because of the brighter and more detailed viewfinder and the easy manual focus.",
      "Ease of use, Yes more buttons manual focus rings, works faster, focus fast ect.",
      "Higher build quality, more weight, It feels like if you really wanted to get serious about photography at almost a professional level this is what I would use.",
      "They concentrate on too many things as a general use camera.",
      "Again street photography is the last thing i would use it for.",
      "I'm certainly glad I purchased this niche camera, especially at a used price and with Amazon's return policy.",
      "First off, I\u2019ve used my P900 for a couple of years on any photo shoot you can name.",
      "I\u2019ve used it as a video capture to single exposures.",
      "The menu is easy to use very similar to the P900.",
      "I\u2019ve used all my zoom lenses, telescopes, more telescopes but it is hard to track with lots of extra gear and weight.",
      "It\u2019s mandatory for me, but I settled in this case because its a trade off for the zoom factor.",
      "It looks, feels, and pretty much performs like a higher end D750, except it has all the features that enable less experienced photographers take great pictures... things like scene mode, time lapses, it\u2019s so user friendly but has all the manual functions a camera snob like me demands.",
      "I almost bought the P900, but didn\u2019t because of the lack of raw format.",
      "Every picture I have taken with digital zoom, I have deleted because of image quality\n\u2022 Many throw away pictures.",
      "\u2022 I use a monopod and have not used the flash yet.",
      "After a month or so of use I have to say the camera is radically good.",
      "Pictures are from my P900, I expect better from my new P1000\nI see here and on You Tube reviewers talking about the weight of the camera, If you're use to a camera this big or heavy, you're going to keep on it a tripod.. that's a waste of a great camera.",
      "Two years ago before I got the P900 I used a Canon D5 Mark II and with a 24-105 len it was just as heavy and that was my go to camera for weddings, portraits, for my special events, sporting (NHRA drag racing) NFL football and college football games, nature, landscapes and many places where I can't use a tripod.",
      "So far I like this camera, I think many camera users are good photographers, they could be great if they stay away from the auto setting much as possible with a good camera as the P1000, I still plan to use my P900 when it calls for it, but I love shooting in raw which you can't with the P900.",

      "But the Lumix doesn't have a 3000 mm zoom lens, which is the Nikon's raison d'\u00eatre.",
      "I've taken it out to take photos and enjoy the lesser weight than that of a 500mm or 600mm lens attached to a Nikon D7100 and get tremendously closer photos than I could with either of those lenses.",
      "The mechanics in the lens can cause motion even when on a tripod.",
      "At full extension of the lens, you only get a part of the moon.",
      "Craters are crisp and there are more visible than I had ever gotten with a large detachable lens.",
      "Also, not having to change lenses for each situation is handy.",
      "Everyone has their own idea of what is ideal in a camera and lens.",
      "The lens itself, autofocus, features of the camera, etc., are really fun!",
      "just not fun when on a tripod and you dont have a lens stabilizer.",
      "Clearly the zoom lens is the best feature.",
      "Unbelievable reach with its 3000mm lens.",
      "Its heft and weight, however, I find are useful assets when filming at lens max.",
      "This is a great camera if you are taking a lot of variety of pictures from closeups of flowers, to family shots, to scenes and birds and animals and don\u2019t want to have to change lenses.",
      "As seen in the far right picture, the P1000 is about 1.5 times bigger than my D5500 with the Tamron 18mm-400mm lens.",
      "I have found that it really beats carrying around extra lenses.",
      "When I extended the lens all the way to 3000 mm on my original tripod, the tripod almost went face-first onto the ground.",
      "Purists will say you could have a bigger sensor, or more lens control, or blah blah blah.",
      "This is a \"bridge camera;\" it delivers superb pictures up close, and it delivers mind-blowing moon pictures, all without stopping to change lenses."
