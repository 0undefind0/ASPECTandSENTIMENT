    "I purchased this laptop with the primary intent to be able to run ML models and use it for the DS program that I'm in. I wanted something upgradeable with solid core hardware and this fit my budget. My comments about the machine are not from a gaming perspective.\n\nScreen\nI saw others comment that this wasn't the best screen for gaming. It's not the brightest thing in the world and almost reminds me of a matte screen - even though it is not.\n\nKeyboard\nI've typed on worse (I'm looking at you, Macbook) and better (my trusty Lenovo) and this keyboard is okay. If I had to give it a grade it would be mid-point. I'm thinking of key travel and comfort - it kind of falls in the middle. I sometimes lose my home keys, so it can take a moment to reorient. I do like the number pad, it comes in handy here and there. Using mostly a traditional keyboard I hit Home and End quite a bit. This keyboard has them paired up, so you have to hit Fn if you want to End. I work a lot in code, data, and spreadsheets, and it can be frustrating at times. Keep in mind my use case is probably not the average user and it's not THAT bad.\n\nThis sucker is a fingerprint magnet, I have not spent any significant time to find the proper cleaning technique. :P\n\nUpgradeability\nAs I mentioned, I wanted something I could upgrade, which I did. From some of the other reviews it seems like these shipped with a single 16GB stick of RAM. My unit came with two 8GB sticks, so the extra 16GB stick that I ordered with the unit was returned. I ended up buying a 64GB kit (CT2K32G48C40S5) that works just fine. I am unable to see what timings are being used - cannot see in BIOS, nor via CPUID. I thought that was odd, but everything I'm seeing shows that I have 64GB. For most people this is way overkill, but for my needs I can end up utilizing quite a bit.\n\nThe SSD that came with the unit was a 512GB - I cloned it over to 1TB Samsung 980 and threw in another 1TB Samsung 980.\n\nI should mention that the back was extremely easy to remove and upgrading the components was super easy. It should be noted that one of the screws does not come out of the back all the way - by design. There are also multiple screw lengths, so be very aware of what goes where.\n\nOS\nIt comes with Win11 - frankly not a fan of it. I have considered wiping and trying to put Win10 or Linux on, or even dual boot. For now I'll leave it, but wanted to make sure you know it's coming with Win11.\n\nSoftware\nHas a bit of bloatware, but it's minimal. I was expecting there to be more, but it's not too bad.\n\nBattery life\nI think if you try to game on battery you'll be disappointed. Firing up local databases and running models gives me 3~ish hours of battery. If I push it hard it will probably drop. Now, I leave it in \"performance mode\" most of the time, so I'm sure that has an effect on it. If you're a gamer I hope you're looking at other reviews :D\n\nOverall thoughts\nI like this laptop, it's very functional and gave me decent bang for the buck performance. Even spending a bit extra on upgrades left me in a good spot. If you're shopping for this one, good luck on your decision!",
    "It's pretty good, especially if you can get it for sub $1,150. Has some annoying caveats to it's otherwise great specsheet.\n\nPositives:\n\n* Has a great processor, overkill for most things. The 3060 will bottleneck this way before the CPU does.\n* Has a dedicated GPU\n* It doesn't look as gamery in person as it does in the product pics, which is good.\n* It can charge off USB C and features a decent selection of IO, media keys, etc.\n* It isn't too heavy, and is pretty thin all things considered.\n* Keyboard is decent, nice inclusion of numpad\n\nNegatives:\n\n* NO WINDOWS HELLO CAMERA OR FINGERPRINT SENSOR.\n\n* The battery life isn't great, possibly due to bloatware. (about 2.5 - 4 hours in power saving mode with keyboard LEDS off)\n* There is a lot of bloatware running in the background. Have fun cleaning this up so it doesn't eat your battery.\n* It doesn't come with a USB C charger, so if you don't wanna lug the battery brick around, you are gonna have to buy a different charger.\n* This laptop doesn't support S3 sleep, it uses windows modern sleep. This drains the battery 7%/night. Also, it has useless LEDS that show the SSD is still running in sleep mode.\n* The screen and speakers aren't the loudest or brightest.\n* Doesn't have a 120hz screen refresh rate, ONLY 60 or 144, which it can't hit in many games.\n\nOverall, it's a great laptop, though the inclusion of Amory crate, Mcafee, and other bloat makes it a hassle to clean up. The batterylife isn't great because it doesn't support s3 sleep and W11 has problems with performance profiles. This means when you unplug it, it won't automatically go into 60 hz mode, disable most P cores, turn battery saver on, turn off all silly gamer LEDS. Which means you are really eating into that battery. For the price and weight, this laptop isn't bad. The fact it can charge off 100W type C is really nice. The specs on paper are great, and it doesn't seem to throttle or run into performance issues.\n\nIdeal specs for this laptop would a Intel i7 1260P, 100wh battery, 3060, cold air intake on the top of the laptop, USB C charger included, since it can do up to 240W over C. Slightly move IO around so it wasn't all on one side. No bloatware and all armorycrate functions moved to BIOS/UEFI. Support for S3 sleep so that it actually goes to sleep instead of just still running, lol.",
    "I've wanted something that I could use as an everyday computer for work and use for gaming in my off time, something that could combine productivity and gaming in a compact design. I did a lot of research and found several (Razor Blade, Sager) but they were just too far out of my price range. I was worried I was being unrealistic for my budget. Then I came across the 2022 ASUS TUF Dash 15 (FX517ZM-AS73).\n\nFrom a physical standpoint I find the form factor is great in the hands and taking it mobile is a breeze thanks to it's compact, lightweight and super sleek design. I can easily pop it into my messenger bag when I need it on the go and when at home I can hook it up to a secondary display and enjoy gaming on it like I would a desktop.\n\nUnder the hood it's clear ASUS wanted to make an impression. The hardware is impressive, yes, but how it synergies together is the most impressive part. Across the board performance is near instantaneous and (if power options and Armory Crate are utilized well) the battery life is also quite impressive when used for productivity tasks, too.\n\nThe hardware is an ensemble cast with an Intel Core i7-12650H, 16GB of lightning fast DDR5 memory, a 512GB M.2 SSD and a 6GB GeForce RTX 3060 Mobile to round it out. It should be mentioned that while the computer itself supports Gen4 M.2 drives the stock 512GB SSD is Gen3 - likely to cut costs - however don't let that deter you as for an O/S drive it works great. Also, in a nice change of pace this laptop can be completely upgraded and you won't find any hardware soldered to the board. I have since added a 1TB Samsung 990 Pro in the second M.2 slot (for game installs, storage) and could not be happier with the near-instant performance.\n\nSpeaking of performance I have yet to find a game title that I am unable to max out the settings on, even when hooked up running UHD resolutions on my secondary display (I have an LG UltraGear 27GL83A-B) which takes advantage of the G-Sync support for silky smooth response times. I've not yet even needed to use the \"Turbo\" mode as everything gets handled quite comfortably using the \"Performance\" setting.\n\nASUS did their homework when they designed the 2022 iteration and you can tell they were paying attention, the 2022 Dash 15 corrects many of the complaints from the previous years model and then some. The new cooling system design is incredibly effective and helps cut back on a lot of fan noise, even when under load (using the \"Performance\" setting) the fans when kicked up are barely audible while keeping everything nice and cool.\n\nI'm very impressed with this machine and can easily recommend it to anybody interested in this model. No matter if you're looking for a dedicated gaming laptop or something to use for daily productivity tasks and some gaming on the side the 2022 ASUS TUF Dash 15 (FX517ZM-AS73) is hard to beat for performance and value.",
    "I bought this laptop on the 3rd of April and got it on the 11th even though tis only been 2 days i can tell a few things, any expectations you have of this laptop regarding gaming will be met and some more This beauty will give you frames like you havent seen before( i came from a gtx 1060 and i7 8th gen) and the battery life not so sure but when connected to an external display will be 2 hours and 40 minutes but on its own it will probably be double that for a gaming rig this will rival quite a few desktops highly recommend now the flaws when on turbos this sounds like a jet (i mean it) and 1 more flaw i have a 165 hz external monitor and when connected to it the laptop couldnt only support 120 hz i got it checked and the fault was in the laptop nonetheless this is still a great buy\nI tested 2 games and hear are the fps\nGTAV - VeryHigh/Ultra settings =120+fps ( i cant say since my external monitor is capped but it can easily go more than 120 fps)\nValorant- Shooting Range=600+fps Ingame=(Low settings)=400+/)High settings)=300+",
    "I got this laptop mainly for one game. It is very lightweight, unexpectedly light, and beautiful. Sleek, the keyboard blinks with its light, and the track pad and keys are smooth.\n\nIf I unplug it, my laptop cannot stay on for over an hour when playing my game. It drops so quickly. Even with battery saver, brightness low, and every other setting to accommodate doesn't help. I played for an hour unplugged and by 20 mins, it dropped 30%, and by the hour it wad about 16% left.\n\nIt gets pretty hot. If left on my lap, I had to keep moving it cause my skim felt burning. The fans are also kind of loud. Not very loud but very noticeable.\n\nThe track pad is nice and big but with that, my hand kept touching it when I'd use my fingers and it didn't quite register I was moving the mouse. I've had to get an actual mouse to use cause my hand kept touching it when I tried not to.\n\nOverall, I still love the laptop, but it is not as portable as I wanted or expected. I can only really play games if it's plugged in, or if I have 30 minutes.",
    "Really nice laptop, so far. I purchased this in August and put off writing a review until after I'd used it for several months. I wanted a laptop with a dedicated GPU, a fast 12th Gen Intel CPU, and Windows 11, but wanted to keep the price under control. This laptop fit the bill perfectly.\n\nMy previous laptop was a 2-in-1 with a slightly larger touch screen. While I occasionally miss that capability, the higher resolution screen and the addition of the dedicated NVIDIA GPU make up for it. The screen is great - the high resolution is very sharp, and the screen is nice and bright with good colors. This laptop is very fast and more than adequate for the games that I play, or any other use I have for it.\n\nIf battery life is your primary concern, you will be happier with a lower powered laptop, but you probably wouldn't be shopping for a gaming laptop. The battery life is not great but it's acceptable for a gaming laptop, if you set up the Power and GPU settings correctly.\n\nWhen using the NVIDIA GPU, this laptop is very power hungry, but that's to be expected. The Windows 11 \"Display Graphics\" settings can be used to set applications to specifically run on the Intel GPU (\"Power Saving\") or specifically run on the NVIDIA GPU (\"High Performance\"). The Intel GPU is more than adequate for daily use (and some lower resolution gaming), and uses significantly less power.\n\nAdd a dock and external monitors, and this laptop is also a more than adequate workstation replacement.\n\nMy only personal quibble with this laptop is the amount of preinstalled software. Asus preinstalls several applications to customize the user experience (and provide data to Asus) -- not all of these are useful, and all of these are designed to require user identifiable connections to Asus, and agreeing to their terms of service. These aren't terribly hard to uninstall (so they will no longer pester you to register) but it's always irritating.",
    "So far I like this computer a lot, I think that performance is good. The cost for that performance however, is the battery, it will not last more than a couple of hours unless you put battery saver. The fast charging feature is very good to compensate, but this only work if you can find where to connect. Overall I really like this machine, perform very good for my work and when i need to take a break I play some games without issues. I do recommend this product.",
    "Rese\u00f1a con una semana de uso, actualizare si veo mas fallas:\n\nEl equipo funciona bien, y tiene los componentes descritos, aun que en ocasiones he sentido tirones. Siento que pude haber conseguido algo similar por menos dinero.\n\nRaz\u00f3n por la que le quito 1 estrellas\n- Un detalle importante, es que los botones est\u00e1n con la distribuci\u00f3n del sistema ingles. (por eso le doy 4 estrellas, siento que deber\u00edan incluir la opci\u00f3n de elegir que distribuci\u00f3n se desea).\n-A veces siento tirones(aun que son m\u00ednimos) y he tenido problemas de conexi\u00f3n con YouTube(un par de veces), me ha pasado con simplemente usar google chrome y microsoft edge, puede que sea por actualizaciones necesarias o problemas de servidor o conexi\u00f3n. Espero que ande bien en otras aplicaciones.\n\nOtras apreciaciones:\n-El conector del cable de alimentaci\u00f3n el\u00e9ctrica esta en la mitad del equipo, estaba acostumbrado a laptops con el conector en una esquina.\n-El teclado es completo, tiene el teclado num\u00e9rico, y la pantalla es mas alta de lo que estaba acostumbrado.\n-Dise\u00f1o elegante, silencioso de momento.\n-No conoc\u00eda el puerto thunderbolt4, creo que no lo usare, y siento que eleva el precio del articulo.",
    "The media could not be loaded.\nWe updated the driver for the graphics card to see if that would rid the display of the weird strip of light on the left side of display. It didn't repair the issue. We tried calling Asus but they seem to only have a 'chat' box for communicating and after waiting for an hour we gave up as no one from ASUS responded. Obviously, this flashing strip of light at the edge of the display screen is mentally fatiguing and unhealthy. Will see if ASUS replies this weekend or if we need to return the laptop.\n\nUpdate: We called ASUS Tech Support and they solved the problem by resetting the bios. All good now.",
    "Love this computer! Don't use it for gaming but, it's so quick, light for traveling vs previous laptop, great speakers, great for lots of photos and works well with Zoom meetings.",
    "Mi hermana la usa para sus dise\u00f1os y dibujos gr\u00e1ficos no ha tenido problemas, va super bien",
    "This is a great discrete gaming laptop for school, which is the main reason I purchased it. It gives plenty of options for battery saving and options for how loud the fans are, as well as the typical Nvidia options for your GPU. I did have to upgrade the storage, but is not difficult by any means, just required me to remove a couple of screws and put in the new SSD and put the screws back in. However there are a few downsides to this computer. If you plan on using it on any sort of incline, good luck. The screen doesn't fold back very far which I have found a little annoying at times. Another small complaint is the type of plastic the computer and keyboard are made of. It feels pretty sturdy, however it gets dirty from everything. I consider myself a relatively clean person and I like my hands to be clean, but I find myself having to wipe this keyboard off weekly. No matter how clean your hands are this keyboard manages to get oily and dirty. Other than those small details this is an amazing mid-range laptop for gaming, travel, and school. It is also easily upgradeable if the specs (Ram and SSD Storage) are not to your liking.",
    "Great gaming cpu!!",
    "The laptop exceeded all my expectations. It is a super-fast machine with an extremely well heat dissipation system.",
    "For gaming the results are beyond than expected, run new games smoothly and the fans work really well keeping the laptop fresh, also I use this laptop for coding and it works awesome everything is super fast, really recommended.",
    "Bought this as a mobile rig, and it pretty much ticks all the boxes. only issue, and im not sure if its a user error on my end or just the overall hardware configuration, i burn through battery life like its running on AAs. this is when im trying to do non gaming tasks. notebook is very sleek, the weight is not bad feels balanced. the hardware is more than sufficient. this PC has the essentials and none of the luxuries. perfect for me to throw in a back pack. i was also impressed to see ASUS offers a year warranty that covers raw damage. this pc puts in work and pumps out heat when in turbo mode (plugged in) but overall not to bad when doing light gaming. handles CoD MW2 excellent, and even FiveM (GTA). after shopping around and about to purchase a 2000$+ unit, im happy i found this for half the cost.",
    "Love everything...nothing to hate",
    "Bought to replace my Asus N55S.\nFirst Gen I7 processor with 8 gigs of ram.\nAfter almost 10 years I wanted something better. Wasn\u2019t going to buy a Dell I5 or something with 4,6,8 gigs of ram. Dell is betting you will buy a new computer in a few years. Bought this one on Amazon Warehouse saved about $300.",
    "I've been a long-time ASUS fan. I've got a self-built desktop that uses numerous ASUS components, and have used their laptops in the past (my family business also bought a couple Vivobooks). The designs are usually top notch & well built. This one has a solid LCD housing without too-much flex. The battery life is reasonable for this system; the \"silent\" mode keeps things quiet & cool for non-gaming and non-video/audio production tasks. \"Performance\" mode (predictably) runs the battery down quickly but this mode is best used when connected to a power outlet. The fans are a little loud under heavy loads, but that's also to be expected in such a slim chassis. The speakers are competent but not stellar. The display has a great refresh rate & good viewing angles. I think the i7-12650H model was the right choice as it still gives you all 6 Performance Cores compared to the 12700H, you're losing 4 E-cores but as a mostly stationary/occasionally portable gaming system it's not really a loss. The TB4 & multiple USB ports (that don't block each other by being too close) are all USB 3 & up, no USB 2 here. My model has an SK Hynix Gold P31 SSD (512GB) & I'm plenty happy with that performance. I'll but putting in a second NVMe drive later since the slot on the board is open. Keyboard is good, the touchpad has an excellent feel & spacious.\n\nI've used it with Windows 11 and Manjaro 21; it performance at the expected high level in both OSes.\n\nNo complaints, definitely worth it. It's a great system and I think you'll enjoy using it very much. If you can find it on a sale for $1100 (USD) then it's a definite buy over other brands' 15-inch models.\n\n*Note that a 90-day warranty extension is offered by ASUS for this review.",
    "The only issue is the battery \ud83d\udd0b it don't give me a lot Like 4 to 5 hours otherwise is good price, good laptop \ud83d\udc4d",
    "Esta laptop esta muy bien funciona de maravilla, con buenas caracter\u00edsticas actuales, lo bueno es que si se puede actualizar con mas Ram hasta 32GB dual channel 2x16, y un slot extra para otro M.2. rinde muy bien.\nLo que no me gusto es que el acabado negro mate se marca mucho las huellas y toca limpiar constantemente.\nLa construcci\u00f3n de la tapa es en aluminio y el resto del producto es en un pl\u00e1stico de muy buena resistencia y calidad.\nProducto recomendable? SI, el tiempo lo dir\u00e1.\nEn edici\u00f3n de video y render esta mas que correcto\nSi lo que buscas es no romper tu bolsillo esta es la laptop indicada",
    "For reference I got 16gb RAM, RTX 3060, i7-12650h.\n\nAbout me:\nI am a programmer and gamer, who was very hesitant to switch from desktop to laptop given the amount of time I spend on a computer. Recently at work I got switched to a MacBook pro and a thunderbolt docking station and that has been revolutionary for me. Since this laptop can plug right into my dock I finally felt comfortable to take the leap. And I am very pleasantly surprised! Only a few weeks into ownership and I am not only growing fond of this little machine but I even was able to sell my desktop and JUST use this.\n\nLaptop itself:\nFast. Great at multitasking. Never runs out of juice with 10 cores. I can game, and review code simultaneously.\nIt does run a bit warm when gaming though. Especially the CPU. I personally found turning off turbo via throttle stop to be the best solution and it didn't hit my game quality at all, running 50-70\u00b0c during 6 hour game sessions. Otherwise, I'd still recommend a cooling pad and limit fps. Before turning boost off, and repasting, it was running 75-100\u00b0c (thermal throttle). After repaste it runs 70-90\u00b0c normally during gaming PC\n\nGaming:\nPretty much any game on high to ultra settings, 1080 or 1440p and 60fps is a breeze for this thing. I play far cry 5, halo infinite, Forza horizon 5, etc\nWiFi is blazing fast. I'm pulling 340mbps download in steam which is what I got on my wired PC.\nScreen is decent. Looks good but could be Brighter. The big con of any laptop under $2-2500. But it's brighter than my previous msi laptop so I'm happy\nBattery is good for what it is. ~4-5 hours web browsing or YouTube, 1-1.5 gaming depending on settings but charges lighting fast.\n\nOverall very thin, very light, very good looking laptop and the build qaulity feels great. With a dock it truly becomes a portable workstation",
    "I recently purchased the ASUS TUF Dash 15 (2022) gaming laptop and I have been extremely satisfied with its performance so far. The laptop has a sleek, slim design and is lightweight, making it easy to take on the go.\n\nOne of the standout features of the TUF Dash 15 is its 144hz, 15.6-inch Full HD display, which provides clear and vivid visuals. The laptop is powered by an 12th-generation Intel Core i7 processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics, which deliver smooth and fast performance for gaming and other demanding tasks.\n\nThe laptop also has a good keyboard and touchpad, which are comfortable to use and responsive. The audio quality is also excellent, with the laptop's speakers providing clear and rich sound.\n\nIn terms of storage and connectivity, my TUF Dash 15 has a 1TB SSD and a wide range of ports, including USB-C, HDMI, and USB 3.2 Gen 1. The laptop also has good battery life, lasting for several hours on a single charge.\n\nOverall, the ASUS TUF Dash 15 is a great gaming laptop that offers excellent performance, a high-quality display, and a slim and lightweight design. It is a great choice for those looking for a powerful and portable gaming laptop.",
    "Cumpli\u00f3 mis expectativas.",
    "It is an impressively powerful pc. Easy to add open up and add more storage and new fans (which you might need since this pc gets hot and can easily eat through them.) I have yet to replace any fans, but I'm prepared for when I will need. The laptop also had a gen 4.0 pcie slot for NVME ssd. That is awesome but there is only one and the included ssd is 3.0. So, you would need to reinstall windows if you intended to use the latest ssd.\n\nBattery life may not be great, but having small battery makes the whole laptop lighter and more portable. I personally use the power crave powerpack on amazon to more than triple my total use time.",
    "Got this laptop for an insanely good deal for Black Friday. The laptop specs that I got were what I paid for. Definitely powerful. Speakers aren't amazing, but I usually use headphones anyway. Screen it's super bright, but its fine.\n\nThe main issue I have with this laptop is the build quality.\n\nWhen I originally got the laptop, the LCD backlight had stuck white pixels. I could only see these on a fully black screen while the computer is on (which I don't usually do), so it took me some time to realize it had this defect. I couldn't just return it to Amazon and get a new computer for the same Black Friday price either. I would have had to buy it at its regular full price. I had to use my ASUS warranty in order to fix it which ASUS (not Amazon) did for free.\n\nPart of the reason I got this laptop was for the multiple RAM and SSD slots, allowing me to upgrade it eventually. But taking off and putting on the back piece of the laptop is quite annoying. Multiple plastic hooks which help keep it the back in place have already broken off. In addition, its very easy to put the back on, screw it all in, only to realize that it has opened up on one side on its own. Requires opening the back again and trying to put it on again.\n\nDisclaimer: I will also potentially be getting a 90-day warranty extension from ASUS for this review.",
    "Es una buena laptop, con excelente calidad precio-beneficio. La calidad de materiales y ensamble es correcto (no es un PC premium, pero no se espera que lo sea por ese precio); su rendimiento es muy bueno, corre lo que sea. La temperatura del procesador y la grafica es muy buena cuando juegas; por ejemplo, warzone en graficos altos, no pasa de 78\u00b0, al menos que haya una actualizaci\u00f3n en segundo plano o que Defender este chequeando el PC. Sin embargo, para mantener estas temperaturas se debe tener una base o almuhadilla refrigerante. Para las tareas diarias, es mas que suficiente; con la APP Armory Create (es una excelente APP de Asus para gestionar el poder del PC), puedes activar el modo eco de la GPU cuando no necesites tareas exigentes, esto desactiva la tarjeta grafica dedicada y el PC se mantiene muy fresco para trabajo suave con temperaturas entre los 45 - 50\u00b0 sin necesidad de base refrigerante, trabajando adem\u00e1s de forma muy silenciosa lo que se agradece en la oficina o en la Universidad. La calidad de la camara no es muy buena, pero realmente casi no la uso. Cuando usas toda la potencia de PC, los ventiladores suenan bastante fuerte, pero en esos casos generalmente uso audifonos, as\u00ed que no me molesta.

This thing has been disappointing of both the hardware and the software front and as of right now I strongly regret buying it.\n\nStarting with the hardware, ASUS seemed to have cut as many corners as possible to bring the price of this machine down. On some level that's expected. Afterall, you're getting a 3060 gaming laptop for close to a grand, so thinking this is going to be a premium laptop is unrealistic. However, this system doesn't even meet the standards that most would expect from a budget laptop.\n\nFor starters, one of the cooling fans is already failing and causing a grinding buzzing noise, with less than 4 months of use. I'm a fairly tech savvy person and I've replace fans in laptops before. Usually replacement parts are cheap and easy to find, but for this particular model, fans are almost non-existent, even on eBay. As a cherry on top, to remove the particular fan that's broken, you must remove the entire cooling system. That's right. Replacing the fan also means you're going to have to replace all the thermal paste on the CPU and GPU. Now of course you could ship this off to ASUS and enjoy a long period of not having you're computer available, but something as simple as a broken fan shouldn't be this much of a headache to fix yourself.\n\nAnd then there's the paper-thin flimsy frame. It's so weak that I can click the track pad by pressing on the bottom of the case. I've used this laptop while laying down and accidently clicked the track pad just by holding it from the bottom, with almost no pressure exerted. It's remarkable cheaply made. I imagine even a fall from a modest height would send this thing laptop heaven.\n\nThe last hardware pain point is the screen. While the image quality is about what you'd expect from a laptop at this price point, the backlight bleed is absolutely terrible. Most of the time it's not noticeable but if you're watching something that has a dimly lit scene it can be very distracting. I've owned several laptops in this category and the screen on this is by far the worst in terms of bleed.\n\nAnd now we come to the software. Oh boy... Like many manufactures, ASUS uses there own proprietary software to mange system performance. ASUS' is called Armoury Crate. It is easily one of the most buggy and inconsistent pieces of software I've ever used. Sometimes it doesn't change modes properly. Sometimes it says it needs updates, but refuses to install them. Other times it decides to fire up all fans at idle, even in silent mode with no applications open. It's simply a mess. Now you might be wondering, \"Well can't I just uninstall it and use other system management tools?\" and while you probably could, you would miss out on one of the key selling points of this laptop: it's built-in MUX switch. This switch, as far as I can tell, is only controllable through Armoury Crate, so if you want to use it you're stuck with their broken software.\n\nOverall, I would steer clear from this one. I know, I know, it's tempting for the price... But it's simply not worth the trouble of dealing with both hardware and software problems. If it was just one of these things, maybe it'd be worth it. But there are many other options available that offer a far more reliable experience than this laptop.",
    "1era opini\u00f3n Aunque en los primeros d\u00edas me tiro un reinicio raro, luego no tuve ningun problema a la hora de usarla, corre bien en juegos como Valorant, Spiderman, as\u00ed tambien en programas de Arquitectura como D5 Render, Lumion, Autocad, sin ning\u00fan problema si tuviera que ponerle un pero es el almacenamiento pero eso se soluciona usando el slot de ampliaci\u00f3n, tambien destacar que ninguna ram esta soldada, es decir ambos son reemplazables sin tener que prescindir del dual channel de ram\n2da Opini\u00f3n ahora despu\u00e9s de un a\u00f1o, puedo decir que es de las peores compras que he realizado lastimosamente, puntos a tener en cuenta, los componentes son extremadamente peque\u00f1os es muy fina, si pero es implica mala optimizaci\u00f3n, se acumula polvo en ventiladores y empiezan a funcionar mal, con ruido, le hice mantenimiento de los mismo cada 4 meses, los tornillos traseros salieron por si solos, y para acabar la bisagra se rompi\u00f3 por alguna raz\u00f3n, nada de eso me pas\u00f3 con una Dell anterior en fin, gente evitense una mala compra y vayan por alguna gamer de alta gama y no de entrada como esta",
    "This computer is super fast; definitely the fastest computer I have ever had. I pretty much use this solely for the Sims 4, and the loading time is literally seconds. With my older computers, it took minutes for the game to load. I would never go to other worlds, because it took so long to load. I am finally able to play the game, without dreading it. I am in love with this computer!",
    "The media could not be loaded.\nI loved the design. It's pretty, although a little dirty, since it's a magnet for fringerprints, but nothing a little cleaning can't solve.\nI got the version of 16GB ram and core i7 12th gen, and it's a beast. There's no program this laptop can't run. I've had it for a couple of weeks and I mainly use it for engineering (solidworks, matlab, autocad 3D, etc) and it runs everything smoothly.\nI've only had the chance to try it on fornite, but it can run it with everything in epic quality, so I expect it to run any other game without any problem.\nIt's, in my opinion, a great laptop for university students (specially if you study engineering like me, or architecture), who want a great experience working on it and also playing video games.\n\nI haven't had any problem with fans or temperatures as others comments mention, but this is just my experience with this device.\n\nI had it for $1069 + $65 on taxes, and it was definitely worth it.\n\nI'm from Mexico btw, but I asked a friend of mine who was in USA that brought it to me and it's just perfect.",
    "The bad. The laptop gets way too hot and the battery only last about two hours. Even if I enable \u201cbattery saving mode\u201d and \u201ceco mode\u201d, it never gets past two hours. I thought about getting a cooling fan for the laptop but the reviews say that the cooling fans for laptops aren\u2019t good or that they\u2019re cheaply made and most don\u2019t blow strong air. It\u2019s going to get warmer during this time of year and I don\u2019t want to worry about heat syncope. As for the battery life, I don\u2019t want to be plugged in to the wall all the time. Not to mention the time and cost of replacing the battery when it swells up and gets damaged. I thought I could get at least 4-5 hours of battery life but the laptop dies way too soon.\n\nThe good though is that the screen is big, bright, and colorful and the sound of the speakers are great. I\u2019m a big fan of Hi Res Audio and this laptop came with it. I plugged in my High Res Audio headphones and it made it even better. The speed and responsiveness is amazing. I was able to do many things with this laptop and it was far more pleasant to use compared to a budget laptop I bought elsewhere else.\n\nI just wish it had a better battery life and that it didn\u2019t overheat.\n\nAnother thing I must mention is that getting a refund is stressful. It\u2019s been about a month and two weeks (as of writing this review) since UPS came to pick up the laptop and I still don\u2019t have my refund. Which is why I\u2019m never buying anything in monthly payments over $100 if it means waiting months. (I mentioned this in case if you\u2019re thinking of buying it in monthly payments as well as returning it for a refund).",
    "The game was great in terms of running games, it can run games such as GTA and Fortnite with decent graphics. If you are more into games such as Roblox or Genshin Impact it runs them great. Overall the gaming is great, however, the battery is very bad when using it on the go. The best way to get the battery to last is, as is most devices, turning the graphics, screen brightness, and fan speed down. Overall good, could be slightly better.",
    "This checked all the boxes for a gaming machine at the office and on the road. It has been put to work and I have only been impressed with the capability. Don't quite to max out settings on top end games or start dropping frames, but very capable of running anything on some relatively high settings. To be expected, but it blows some serious hot air when putting that 3060 to work. Unfortunately, it blows onto a right hand running a mouse anywhere close to it. I find a cooling base necessary for moving air away if working in tighter area or on lap.",
    "Bueno, me gan\u00e9 la loter\u00eda, y no de la buena.\n\nEsta PC llega a temperaturas alt\u00edsimas, de esas que simplemente son inaceptables y representan un riesgo para el hogar.

Esto significa que ahora yo soy el responsable de que la m\u00e1quina est\u00e1 correctamente actualizada: se traslada la carga de esa responsabilidad al consumidor, incre\u00edble, debeer\u00eda de haber un driver o algo que mantenga en las mejorres condiciones dicha PC, no yo.\n-Para seguir con las sorpresas, ni utilizando el driver oficial de Asus compartido por Asus Contact Support, logro instalar ese tal BIOS nuevo, no pasa de 3.4, la que ven\u00eda de f\u00e1brica... es decir, ni sus propias soluciones funcionan para resolver el problema...\n-Otra sorpresa, me llega un correo adicional de parte de Asus indicando que mi garant\u00eda solo incluye reparaciones, es decir, no es posible realizar devoluciones con ellos..., entonces, a este punto no conf\u00edo para nada en esta PC Asus, pero me obligan a quedarme, nada m\u00e1s frustrante que enviar la PC para reparaci\u00f3n, ya que no tengo la PC en mis manos una vez pagado tanto dinero,\n\nSITUACI\u00d3N ACTUAL: He enviado un video a Asus sin ning\u00fan corte mostrando c\u00f3mo el driver no se instala.

    "The graphics and RAM were fine for my usage (mostly internet browsing, VR games and Hogwarts Legacy). I liked that it could be upgraded easily. The \"what-a-teenage-boy-would-like design style\" that is popular on most gaming laptops was more muted here. The sound isn't great. I returned it because I found the screen quality to be lacking. It was cheap and I couldn't get bright enough for my taste. My 2019 Asus laptop is OLED. Why isn't this one?",
    "All specs check out. The temperature on this thing averages over 80 degrees, which means this thing isn't built to last. It is very powerful and plays everything at 60 fps on Ultra, but it gets really hot (gets close to 100 degrees when gaming). I have a laptop fan running on high underneath this laptop and it still gets really hot. I even use it next to a portable ac blowing into it. Nothing helps keep it cool. In essence, yes, it's powerful, but trying to keep this thing under 80 degrees is a huge problem that will result in parts failure within a year; heck, even within 6 months. The battery life is terrible (2 hours on average). When you plug it in, that's when you have full power of the GPU or graphics card. When unplugged (using battery), the gpu runs half powered and is cooler, but with a 2 hour battery life, you have to constantly plug it in to use it. Most laptops I've owned have lasted over 2 years, but this particular one doesn't seem likely to even make it to a year with its heating issues. Considering the cost, it's better to game on desktop as you have more control/options for cooling than a pre-built powerhouse laptop.",

    "I got this laptop for school and for gaming as well. I was a little scared of investing a lot more of money because I don\u2019t know much about computers, but with help of a friend, I ended up getting this one and I\u2019m not disappointed! It\u2019s lightweight, run literally almost if not all games in max setting. I play overwatch 2 a lot and it runs so smooth , better than my ps5. I\u2019m glad I went with this one, def recommend it.",
    "When I started thinking about buying a light and powerful affordable laptop, the only option was the 2021 TUF Dash, but it had a 4-core bottleneck CPU. Later, the 2022 version was released. This model has a good 10-core i7-12650H CPU (6 P-cores + 4 E-cores) and 105W RTX 3060 GPU (80+25 Dynamic boost), so I bought it as soon as I got the chance.\nIt works with heavy applications without any problems, the system is fast and responsive. The gaming performance is excellent, I played Detroit: Become Human with great pleasure on the highest graphics settings.\nIf you want a model with a higher TDP GPU, consider the Asus TUF F15 2022 (not Dash), this model has a 140W RTX 3060 (115+25 Dynamic boost), but it is heavier and larger, so decide what is more important to you. I chose portability.\n*Asus is offering 90-day warranty extension for this review.",
    "I have had this laptop for about a week now. It works great when running games such as fortnite and league of legends at 120 fps. Screen quality is really good and it truly is a very good gaming laptop for its price. My only big issue about longevity I worry about is the laptop still gets very hot while gaming, and it is brand new. The laptop charger brick also gets VERY hot while gaming so just be aware. I still don\u2019t think that should stop you from buying. However, it does make me wonder if this issue will continue to get worse and worse over time and if the laptop will die on me in a 2-3 years.",
    "The media could not be loaded.\n\u2022 I just tried playing Civilization V (an old game released in 2010) at lower than default settings and CPU temperatures were consistently hitting 100\u00b0C (= 212\u00b0F)!\n\nGood for boiling water and starting a fire.\n\nIn case you were wondering, 100\u00b0C is no bueno. As one page states, \"anything between 40\u201365\u00b0C (or 104\u2013149\u00b0F) is considered a safe heat range for a normal workload. While running more intensive apps or games, the normal CPU temp range can increase to between 70\u201380\u00b0C (158\u2013176\u00b0F). ... At the highest loads, your average CPU temps can go up to 80\u201385\u00b0C, but consider this the absolute limit. Sustained CPU temps above 80\u00b0C can do long-term damage to the CPU and its silicon. If your CPU goes higher than 90\u00b0C for several hours, it will likely reduce the lifespan of your processor.\"\n\n\u2022 After 5 weeks' use, flickering screen (see video)\n\n---\n\n\u2022 You have to use ASUS's famously buggy \"Armoury Crate\" software to manage some features.\n\n\u2022 The keyboard lights on my particular laptop are buggy and will often glow on and off when my PC is put to sleep and also when I'm turning it on. (I have no use for these lights and just simply want them to be permanently and completely disabled.)\n\nYes I have already tried pretty much all possible permutations of settings in the \"Armoury Crate\" lighting but to no effect. (I also haven't been able to find anything in the BIOS settings that can help me turn off the lighting.)\n\n\u2022 Surprisingly slow\n\nFirefox frequently hangs (which rarely happened with my much older laptop).\n\nFrom a UserBenchmark test I just ran:\n\nPC Status: Overall this PC is performing as expected (54th percentile). This means that out of 100 PCs with exactly the same components, 46 performed better. The overall PC percentile is the average of each of its individual components.\n\nProcessor: With an outstanding single core score, this CPU is the cat's whiskers: It demolishes everyday tasks such as web browsing, office apps and audio/video playback. Additionally this processor can handle moderate workstation, and even light server workloads. Finally, with a gaming score of 93.8%, this CPU's suitability for 3D gaming is excellent.\n\nGraphics: 15.6% is a below average 3D score (RTX 2060S = 100%). This GPU can handle older games but it will struggle to render recent games at resolutions greater than 1080p. (Note: general computing tasks don't require 3D graphics)\n\nI'm not sure if I'm just unlucky and got a somewhat defective laptop.\n\n\u2022 There's no specific manual for this specific model. Instead, on ASUS's website, all you'll find is a single manual covering all of their 20+ (30+?) \"TUF\" models.\n\n\u2022 Before buying this in early Dec 2022, I'd been under the mistaken impression (based on the Q&A here) that there were two RAM slots with one filled in by a single 16GB stick and the other empty. But unfortunately, both slots are filled in (2x8GB sticks).\n\n\u2022 I asked (1) here; (2) by email to ASUS; and (3) by email to Crucial whether I could add an old SSD . I got no responses from anywhere.\n\n\u2022 It was VERY difficult for me to open the back (contrary to the experiences of some here and also my experience with other laptops, including another ASUS model).\n\n\u2022 The screw for the second SSD slot was screwed in extremely hard and could not be unscrewed. I first tried the \"rubber band/balloon trick\" for stuck screws, but that didn't work. Eventually I had to use a pliers which worked in getting it out (be SUPER careful if you have to use pliers!).",
    "The Thunderbolt 4 port in this computer does not offer charging, only the DP port next to it does, which confuses me as a decision.
