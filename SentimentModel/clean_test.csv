I was first sceptical of this app as I'm not sure whether I will receive authentic products for I have some unpleasant experience with other online app . But I gave it a try and I super love it!

Wonderful and fun games to play to earn coins and many vouchers to offset my purchases .

"Lousy customer support and autocratic policy with Shopee wallet. 2 chats with agent, 5 unanswered calls to their phone line and 2 emails ignored, my issue was not attended to until about a month later. Yet, all they could give me was a templated reply. Be careful with putting money or has someone transfer money to your Shopee wallet. The money would not be returned to you upon request. It must be used via the app. Absurd! Gosh. Even their response to reviews is lame.
