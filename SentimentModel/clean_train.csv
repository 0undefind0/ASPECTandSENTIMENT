"Decided to stop by for breakfast by myself one Sunday morning.  The reviews on Yelp were enticing, so I gave it a shot.  I ordered the Sonora Potato and Sausage Hash (Eggs, Potatoes, Hot Links, Chipotle, Garlic, Onions, Peppers) w/side of Sourdough Toast, $8.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nEyREad5GZd3RiEZA-Irpw?select=TKoW6UY1opAaH4wFxLkFpg

I couldn't wait to take a bite of my dish as I love Hot Links and have never seen it in a Breakfast item before....it didn't disappoint, it was very good.  The Hot Link was actually spicy, which is often not the case.  The Potatoes were very tasty as well.  My only complaint was that it was kind of a small portion...I was left wanting more.

My server was very friendly and welcoming.  She asked how I found the joint and addressed me by name when I left....very cool.

"I have been to Las Glorias twice with people from work.  Both times I was underwhelmed.  The first time I went the service was good.

We were there for over 1.5 hours because we had to wait for EVERYTHING and it was not very busy.  I was not impressed with the food.  They seem to put raw onions in everything, including the cheese enchiladas.  I really dislike raw onions and am a pro at finding dishes without them, but you cannot escape them here.

"On top of how good the food is, their customer service is excellent. I went to eat there on Thursday (the 16th), and had the best server ever. He was the bartender as well, and still payed tons of attention to my table. He was very nice, and very helpful. He had extensive knowledge of the menu. He was also very personable. He laid out samples of their various barbeque sauces while giving some details about each one. He squirted them out onto an extra plate he brought to the table, and he made the shape of a smiley face with all the sauces. He made that dining experience so good that I wish I could write a review about him personally and suggest to his managers that he get a raise! I couldn't hear him when he stated his name over a large group that had just come in and was moving tables, but he was wonderful.
  Also, one of the people with me is from the east coast, and likes vinegar-based barbeque sauce. They didn't have any of that kind in their current rotation of sauces, and he actually went back to the kitchen and explained the situation. A lady from the kitchen made a vinegar-based barbeque sauce from scratch just because one of us had mentioned how much we loved it.
   I've never experienced service like that, and really can't say enough about how great this guy, and all other staff I came into contact with, was! Great job to whoever hired him.
  The food was delicious, I love their fries! Unlike anything you can get anywhere else. I got the country roasted chicken- great seasoning, super moist and tender, while still having that chargrilled/roasted skin (my favorite). All of their sauces are so good; it's hard to choose just one! (And no matter how many times I go there, I always sample each one again).
  All positive things to say about this Famous Daves!

It looks like a bar that should have a few regular bar flies and music that screeches to a halt when someone new walks in. And by that, I mean it's the most endearingly divey of bars.

There's shuffleboard, just give your id to the bartender in return for the pucks. There's pool, but you pay quarters for that.

After we got home and ate them, fast forward 6 hours and we are both puking our brains out.

"Hmm, a bit disappointed. I had been here several times when I used to live in Scottsdale, but that was 3+ years ago, and I must say that I think things have gone downhill here. The bruschetta toppings on the combination platter were odd for the most part, with the exception of the traditional fresh tomatoes and basil, which was delicious and worth mentioning. The provolone on the sausage bruschetta was excessive and the overall combination of flavors just didn't work. The pesto bruschetta was SUPER garlic-heavy, even for someone like me who loves garlic. I couldn't finish either of the latter types of bruschetta. 

Onto the main course - pizza. Had the Toscana, which has mozzarella, tomato sauce, mushrooms, and sausage. The crust was burnt and flavorless and the toppings just seemed kind of bland and strangely old-tasting. I mean, not fresh. Weird, I know. 

I sort of liked the red sangria, but it was a somewhat odd twist on sangria, as it was pretty sweet and not very strong.

Our waitress was awesome! On top of everything, funny and she told us Sam was the head chef and that it was an honor to have him cook our food and that she was so glad we got him, seeing that it was the first time for almost everyone in our group to try a place like this.

"I had business downtown this morning, so I stopped in here for lunch, right around the corner.  I used to go to OSF in Newport Beach, CA way back in the '70s, & I was somewhat amazed that they are still around & that there's one in Phoenix!

Stepping inside, this is the most junked-up restaurant I've ever been to!!!  Ok, except maybe Bahooka Ribs & Grog!*  It's a big place, with soft lighting inside, & rooms all over the place stuffed with tons of furniture, barrels, & so on, cluttering up every one of them!  It's all on purpose, of course, & my booth in the midst of all this craziness was actually completely ok.  (The floor elevation is up & down all over the place, too!) 

Ok, so for my first time (in about 35 years!) I just ordered the ""Pasta Classics - Rich Meat Sauce"", which is their way of saying, ""Spaghetti.""

Some good things:

*  I started with a cup of coffee, & it was excellent!

*  Pretty soon came a mixed lettuce salad, which was simple, but the Ranch Dressing was really tasty!

*  The next thing to hit the table was a little loaf about three by eight inches of hot Sourdough bread, with a cup of whipped garlic butter, all on a breadboard with a suitable knife for cutting it.  It was great!!

A couple of less wonderful things:

*  Some girl (from the kitchen?) brought my spaghetti before I was finished with my salad.

*  I thought the spaghetti sauce was ok, but not great.

Bottom line:  They give you plenty to eat here.  My meal included the beverage, salad (or soup), the hot bread, entree, & dessert.  It was nice & filling, & a good value at $9.99 for everything.    :-)

"I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.Read more",woke nice surpris morn new kindl gift ipad kindl dx guess someon heard complaint heavi difficult extend read get wrong absolut love ipad dx new gener kindl perfect read outsid long period ipad get complet wash sunlight often irrit eye stare coupl hour dx go extend outdoor read period new friend read novel instead replac seem like companion devic differ class ipad work great web brows shop product game etc kindl fall short area kindl work great read novel ipad fall short love extend read magazin newspap research articl etc find dx go without doubt size weight new kindl biggest draw smaller last edit signific margin play around kindl impress look size new kindl blown away absolut perfect size smaller would unmanag larger feel nearli good hold forget compar e reader tri much smaller much lighter biggest complaint previou gener kindl dx speed sometim take push next page actual chang,0

"Sky Harbor is one poor gateway to the city of Phoenix and the Valley of the Sun.  It is outdated, super crowded, it feels dirty and it is the home of US Airways, the biggest carrier in and out of this airport.

Terminal 4 is configured rather poorly.  The terminal reminds me of a backwards E, like the second E in EMIN3M, except that there is another prong to the backwards E.  The concourses are not spacious at all, the seating limited, and consequently the crowds spill out into the walkway areas.
.  
To go from one end of Terminal 4 to the other necessitates using really narrow moving walkways which are on the spine of the E.  It is really hard to maneuver if you want to pass the throngs given the limited space.  The distances are long, the bruises will be many, either to you but most likely given by you as you negotiate your way between flights.

The other thing that must be mentioned is that Sky Harbor is not a business person's airport but rather a tourist airport.  I think that contributes a lot to the chaos.  When an airport is full of amateurs, like Sky Harbor, there are bottlenecks of humanity in all the wrong places.  Further exacerbating the tourist nature of this airport are the snowbirds who flock here so that they can seek skin cancer in all months of the year, not just summer in their native habitats of the Upper Midwest.

Get going on the remodel since it is long overdue and make sure you take in mind the tourists and the business traveler when updating this airport.",sky harbor poor gateway citi phoenix valley sun outdat super crowd feel dirti home us airway biggest carrier airport termin configur rather poorli termin remind backward e like second e emin except anoth prong backward e concours spaciou seat limit consequ crowd spill walkway area go end termin necessit use realli narrow move walkway spine e realli hard maneuv want pass throng given limit space distanc long bruis mani either like given negoti way flight must mention sky harbor busi person airport rather tourist airport think contribut lot chao airport full amateur like sky harbor bottleneck human wrong place exacerb tourist natur airport snowbird flock seek skin cancer month year summer nativ habitat upper midwest get go remodel sinc long overdu make sure take mind tourist busi travel updat airport,1

"I went to 2 Spring Training games at his stadium this year, and had 2 different experiences.  The first game we parked ourselves and passed several incompetent lot attendants just standing there.  As there were no barricades and they made no indication otherwise, we assumed it was ok to pull in.  It was only at this time that they waved their arms and said we had to park at the back of the lot.  This happened 3 times.

The second trip we opted for the free shuttle from Zipps, This took the pain out of their incompetence out of the equation.  Once we got in the park we had a great time both trips.  There is ample shade covering a good portion of the seated area for afternoon games.  Beer prices were a little steep, but we were happy to pay $8 for a pitcher or 2 of Blue Moon at Zipps beforehand to take the sting out of the $8 cups at the field.  

Of all the stadiums I've visited in Phoenix, this one has been the best (aside from parking annoyances).

"I finally saved up the amount I am willing to spend to make my backyard not look like tent city. mind you, i have never been to tent city but i have a feeling they look similar. minus the pool. 

my backard is set up where the pool takes up the entire yard and then a maximum of 5 feet surrounding rock space around the entire pool. welcome to my backyard.

this makes planting difficult. my original dream was to plant oleanders along every wall, let them grow super tall to block all of my neighbors and give me the privacy i've always wanted to skinny dip all summer long. don't judge.

I wanted oleanders because they sounded like a match made in heaven for my lack of green thumb. they're cheap, they flower, they grow fast and they're impossible to kill. well, i found out oleanders roots are too aggressive to be that close to my pool so sadly, no go. (i only have 5 ft, they need 10-15ft) 

I called moon valley to get some ideas so I could do research root systems. the guy on the phone just wanted to get me there. i told him i was looking for suggestions before heading there on this rainy day and he just kept saying in the cheesiest voice known to man 'oh ya, come on down, we have hundreds'.

you have hundreds of plants that are identical to oleanders minus the roots and resemble in price? really??? please list them so i can find out if you're a big fat liar. nope, not listing them. only wanted to get me there. i decided not to go because 1. it's raining, 2. he lied and said oleanders are ok. i just have to have the drip system on 24/7. thanks for your freakin help.  3. he's a liar so even if i went they would lie to me. 4. i hate liars 5. i went in before in the past and told them what i wanted, they gave me a free backyard design and they completely didn't listen to me and created a backyard that cost 2k. who do they think i am? i live in mesa for crying out loud. not paradise valley. i wasn't going to let them waste my time like that again. 

if you're wondering why i could give them a 2nd chance after that- it's bc this time *I* was going to wear the pants in the relationship.

you could have had my entire (low) budget moon valley, but the unwillingness to help or be honest means i will be going elsewhere. someplace that will straight up say 'i can fulfill your skinny dipping in privacy dreams, while making your backyard look pretty as cheaply as possible and i won't destroy your pool while i'm at it'",final save amount will spend make backyard look like tent citi mind never tent citi feel look similar minu pool backard set pool take entir yard maximum feet surround rock space around entir pool welcom backyard make plant difficult origin dream plant oleand along everi wall let grow super tall block neighbor give privaci alway want skinni dip summer long judg want oleand sound like match made heaven lack green thumb cheap flower grow fast imposs kill well found oleand root aggress close pool sadli go ft need ft call moon valley get idea could research root system guy phone want get told look suggest head raini day kept say cheesiest voic known man oh ya come hundr hundr plant ident oleand minu root resembl price realli pleas list find big fat liar nope list want get decid go rain lie said oleand ok drip system thank freakin help liar even went would lie hate liar went past told want gave free backyard design complet listen creat backyard cost k think live mesa cri loud paradis valley go let wast like wonder could give nd chanc bc go wear pant relationship could entir low budget moon valley unwilling help honest mean go elsewher someplac straight say fulfil skinni dip privaci dream make backyard look pretti cheapli possibl destroy pool,0

"Terrible food, terrible service.

I ordered chicken fried rice. The waiter brings me a bowl and says, ""chicken fried rice, right?"" I look into the bowl and it's a bowl of brown rice. This must be a joke. I tell him that's wrong, and next me brings me a bowl of rice, seemingly fried?, with vegetables and no chicken. I bring that back to the counter and say my order had chicken in it, bringing my receipt along. So finally, they bring me a bowl of chicken fried rice.

Or at least their version of it.

I didn't think it was possible to actually screw up something as simple as chicken fried rice. The rice itself was cheap long grain rice. It was inedible due to the how stale/hard it was. Like absolutely no water absorption. And the rice was all covered in something that made it very wet and practically slimy. Disgusting. I have no idea how people can eat this.

Oh, and that server who brought me the brown rice and claimed it was fried rice tried to bring lettuce wraps to the table next to me saying it was their salad. There's a nice picture on the wall which shows you what the salad is supposed to look like, and it's not lettuce wraps.

"Man, if these guys were trying to replicate a gringo bar in Mexico down to every last detail, then they have it absolutely nailed. Sorry to ruin the mystery of the name. The building itself is a spectacle-- a brightly colored fusion of indoors and outdoors with a few different bars, games like the beanbag toss and televised sporting events in every direction, music blaring, a room dedicated to Elvis, and more Chuck Norris jokes than you can count plastered across the walls along with a bevy of posters advertising drink specials. A line of blue footprints painted across the concrete floor leads to the men's room, dollar signs to the ATM... genius stuff, really. It wouldn't have been at all out of place were they to have tried selling surfing monkey statues or trotting out a donkey painted like a zebra for an extra special photo opportunity.

"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go. Until now, nobody quite got it right. In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software. I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon. We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon. The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone. Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands. To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without.

"Kristi's review said, ""Great romantic spot to bring a date. Secures that you will be getting action later, trust me."" Well, that's good enough for me. And before the Yelp paparazzi shows up to muckrack... no I didn't take Kristi to Cheuvront's. I know better than that - I only hang with Kristi at dive bars. 

So I did take my lovely date to Cheuvronts. The decor and ambiance - think wide open and urban and dark without being too dark. It really set a mood. We ordered a bottle of wine from a fantastic list, along with a cheese plate and a pate plate. We had them select the cheeses to pair with the wine we had chosen with a few instructions as to cheese preferences. They have a selection of pates as well, and we had them choose similarly.

The cheese plate contained three cheeses, all superb. It was served with (good!) bread, some nuts, and some dried cranberries. The two pate plate was similarly served with bread and dark, delicious mustard. The pates were fantastic - the cheese plate and pate plate seemed destined to be served together. 

The food and drink were great, the service a little spotty especially since there weren't that many people in there. I'm guessing the waitress just didn't want use to feel like she was bothering us. After taking our time to enjoy the wine, cheese, and pate, we were both feeling full with no room for even dessert. 

Overall, a great meal, my date thought it was one of the best places she had ever been to, and I'm clearly going to have to pay more attention to Kristi's reviews.",kristi review said great romant spot bring date secur get action later trust well good enough yelp paparazzi show muckrack take kristi cheuvront know better hang kristi dive bar take love date cheuvront decor ambianc think wide open urban dark without dark realli set mood order bottl wine fantast list along chees plate pate plate select chees pair wine chosen instruct chees prefer select pate well choos similarli chees plate contain three chees superb serv good bread nut dri cranberri two pate plate similarli serv bread dark delici mustard pate fantast chees plate pate plate seem destin serv togeth food drink great servic littl spotti especi sinc mani peopl guess waitress want feel like bother us take enjoy wine chees pate feel full room even dessert overal great meal date thought best place ever clearli go pay attent kristi review,0

"I've eaten here one time, and I enjoyed a very decent meal.  I'm not really sure if I'll go back though, and I'll tell you why.  The place kind of gave me a strange vibe:

-It didn't *feel* like a restaurant, it almost felt like a business that had turned into a restaurant.

-The take-out menu/brochure was worded pretty peculiarly in places.

-This one's hard to explain, but I sort of sensed some very subtle yet unsettling religious undertones throughout the whole experience.

Had the China wrap.  It was kinda good, even if it did taste like homemade American teriyaki.  In a spinach tortilla.  With a side of yogurt.  --*sigh* Do you see what I mean?  A funny vibe.

"Suede has been around for awhile now. It's no spring chicken. But I still find the place to be a good time, if you can stand the wall-to-wall people and the loooong lines for the bathroom (only the ladies bathroom, of course).  I think the drink prices are normal for a Scottsdale bar and they aren't any higher or lower than what you'll find at Myst, Axis/Radius or Six...strange, don't they all have the same owner??  It's a fun spot to go though and even if you're not feeling it, you can walk right over to Axis or Pussycat and not take much time out of your night to do it since they're right across the street. If it's a good night, Suede plays the best hip hop and rap music to dance to and the floor will be packed.  On a bad night, the DJ is spinning techno crap (I'm not a fan) and my friends and I will go somewhere else for the night.  There is never a cover for girls, although I think there is always one for guys on Friday and Saturday nights.  Guys have to dress up a little too...I think Suede follows the no hat rule and the bouncer may take a look at your shoes too- guys can't wear sandals or sneakers (I think!)

No one ever makes you feel rushed but instead take time to make sure that everything is okay, that you've thought of everything, gotten all of your questions answered, and had plenty of time to make decisions and think.  The doctor takes time to get to know you and to talk about how you use your eyes (staring at the computer, sports, etc).  The assistants try to think of things from your point of view so they can volunteer useful information and ask a lot of specific questions while doing so.  This place treats you like family.

"Got together with Mike C. to go out to a Thanksgiving Buffet today.  We tried for Golden Corral down the street in Gilbert but the line was way outside, so we came up here where there was also a wait, but shorter.  It was good, as always, but there were some negatives this time:

*  The soups:  There was an ordinary Corn Chowder, a weak Cream of Broccoli, & ordinary Chicken Noodle.  They should have done better than this for Thanksgiving.

*  There was no cottage cheese.  (They don't always have it, but at these prices they should have some today.)

*  There was turkey, but breast meat only & no dressing!

*  Over at the dessert bar there was no hot fudge (& it looked not as if it had run out, but rather that they just didn't offer any today).

*  There were no sundae cups.  I had to go over & get a soup bowl to make a sundae.

*  There was Hot Lava Cake (or ""Hot Fudge Cake"" I think they call it here), but it was sorely lacking in lava!

Thus, it's down to 2 Stars for this restaurant that wasn't as good as it should have been for the money.

"Lets just set the record straight here. Zoe's serves Mediterranean just like Qdoba serves Mexican.

When I say just like the Q, I mean the entire experience. Walking into the shop gives more of a cookie cutter national chain feel; which is probably because they are in fact a chain of restaurants. Zoe's food was average and unimpressive. I did like the hummus though. Their prices similar to independent and family operated Mediterranean around the valley; in some cases more. I would prefer to visit Cypress Grill, just up the street from this location, they're my favorite Medi in CenPho so far. 

The staff here was friendly, they took our order promptly and served the food within a few minutes. Don't get me wrong, the food was in no way ""bad"", per se. I just can't shake the feeling of ""I've had better"" when thinking about my experience.

If you're looking to fill your belly with food just because it's time to eat, this might just be the place for you. If you're interested in a great Mediterranean meal, I implore you to please try something new. I likely won't be returning, we do live in the city of a million restaurants, go out and choose one!

"I am thrilled with the new Fire HD8 - even before it gets Alexa! At that time I will likely be ecstatic! I am far from a tablet novice - I had the original fire the 50 fire the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and the Galaxy Tab S 10.5. My phones have always been Samsung flagship phones, currently the S7 Edge. I say this to show that I 1) have experience with kindle fires, and 2) generally tend to have high standards for my most used devices -- I KNOW what is a good tablet and what is a so-so tablet. Admittedly, my previous fires have been so-so, but I wanted something inexpensive yet adequate to take places with me instead of my Galaxy Tab S 10.5.My HD8 is the 32gb option, with offers. Most users will likely be fine with 16gb and perhaps an added 32gb or 64gb SD card. However, I know how I use my devices, so went with the 32gb option, as well as a 64gb micro SD card. In the 48 hours I have had my new Fire, it has become my device of choice, even over my 500 samsung (more convenient size). I use the large samsung tablet as a computer replacement whereas the new Fire replaces my two 7 inch tablets as the go to device.Before receiving it, I wasn't sure about the low resolution (1280 x 800) on this tab, but honestly, it's not a problem! Sure, it's not bright and beautiful like my Tab S ... but its crisp, clean, and clear. The colors are sufficient, but not vibrant, sadly. (The comparison photo below is the HD8 (2016) and Fire 7 (2015).Sound is quite good, with good volume. The speakers are on the left side when portrait, on top (or bottom) in landscape.

"My wife and I came here to see what they had to offer. As we had bought a king size bed frame and bed. However because we can still cancel our order and felt our decision was on the whim as the mattress we originally purchased was on sale from another furniture store.

We came here to see what other options we had to choose from. Upon entering I already was prepared for the sales man attack, however we were taken back by how friendly and non pressuring environment we entered in. George the salesman was very informative on the beds, and was trying to gauge what we were looking for. After narrowing down to 3 beds another couple came in, we told him we can attend to them while we continued to drill down. He checked on us a few times and answered a few questions we had, but was not breathing down our necks.

"I knew when I was heading to Papago Brewing that I was going to get some good beer. What I didn't expect was some pretty decent bar-style thin crust pizza as well. 

My table ordered the T-Rex, which is basically loaded with every pizza topping made from a pig. My friend was in from out of town, so I said F it, and ate plenty without worrying about it. The pizza was thin, crisp, greasy and delicious. It was everything bar-style pizza should be. As for the beer, I got to try a few of Papago's own brews that I hadn't tried before. Their beers are either very flowery or have a bold coffee bean kind of aftertaste. Good stuff all around, but go with some of the other beers on tap if you're looking for a classic tasting brew. 

Although the food and beer were good, the service kind of sucked. The server was helpful for sure, but he was all over the place and the food took a very long time to be served. I'm not sure if they were short-staffed the night I went, but if the service was more consistent, my experience would have been better. 

That being said, Papago is still a pretty great little spot.

"I really expected crappy food, because, after all, that's what sports bars generally offer.  Then I was told that the food was not bad, but good!  Which only made me eye my table mates suspiciously.  I ordered the tacos al carbon which comes with cilantro lime rice.  these are three street taco sized dealies that have steak in them and come with a little shot of pico and queso.

Now like I said, I expected crap.  But the tacos, with pico and queso poured on them, and grease dribbling out into a glorious puddle on the plate, were really amazingly good.  The steak bits were really tender--ordinarily in such a taco they'd be the tenderness of jerky.  Really: the tacos were totally sensational.

Also, we ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread which is essentially a pizza.  And it was great!  even with the bleu cheese, which I detest, this was a culinary delight.

So why the four stars, you ask?  two reasons.  One: the cilantro lime rice is offensively bad, like straight out of a box of rice-a-roni bad.  I would have preferred kibbles and bits as a side item.

And one other thing: it was happy hour and for a while they were serving beer OUT OF PITCHERS THAT WERE IN THE REFRIGERATOR INSTEAD OF STRAIGHT OUT OF THE TAP!  Capital crime.  Felonious.  In fact, Dante wrote about a circle of hell where all they did was serve beer out of pitchers instead of straight from the tap.

So you should know that although the beer serving would usually be a four star deduction and I'd never look back, I didn't drink beer tonight and so I really don't care if my table mates suffer.  But if you try that shit on me...

Four stars.

They've always done a great job, and the price is reasonable (30$/hour) compared to other places in the area (cheapest I've found is 28$ at other places with a coupon). They also give you a full bottle of water when you finish.

A few weeks back my boyfriend and I wanted to get a little buzzed at home, so we decided on streets of new york to deliver us some grub. We went with pasta. My boyfriend got the spaghetti with meat balls, and I got the meat ravioli. Ah I really hate to say this, but I would have had a better time eating a can of Chef Boyardee. I don't know what is up with their ""beef/sausage"" but it always has a funny taste to it. Kind of like when you re-heat a hamburger in the microwave. That taste. I was less than impressed. The salad it came with was decent, and I'd go back just for the bread, but even with a buzz I wasn't enjoying my pasta. The boyfriend agreed it lacked flavor and was 'off'. 

Then yesterday we decided to have another one of these nights, and do the Pizza instead since our pizza was good the first round. I got chicken and pepperoni on mine, and he got sausage. They charge extra for chicken. Um.. I don't really understand why. The chicken is breaded chicken strips that they just cut up and threw on the pizza. I wasn't impressed AT all. The sausage on my boyfriends pizza tasted weird and sweet like.... I don't know what's up with this place!

"Let me first start off by saying I was skeptical.  I had no idea what to expect and after reading a ton of reviews, we thought we would give it a shot. 

Located in an old converted home in Heritage Park right across from Pizzeria Bianco the place is small and intimate and just an experience in and of itself.

Now for the food.  Where do I begin?  Tapas (small plates) style, and community (share) the experience is in ordering from each section of the menu.

We started with the Kimci and Nasu.  The Kimci is a Napa cabbage cold plate that will rock your world; a little sweet, a little spicy it was a great way to start.  

The Nasu is an eggplant with a bacon marinade of sorts on top and while I am describing it poorly it was truly delishous.  Amazing!!

Next was the Yellowtail Ceviche.  This WAS OUT OF THIS F'ING WORLD.  Inexplicable but so, SO GOOD.  

Next was 2 off the menu plates, chicken and Wagyu beef short ribs.  The ONLY REASON this place does not get 5 stars is 2 of the 3 different types of chicken were mediocre.  The wasabi grilled chicken was pure wasabi on grilled chicken.  

The 2nd was a panko fried chicken, which was moist and delishous but nothing amazing, HOWEVER the 3rd chicken was an orange peel fried chicken that way just so good beyond words.

Lastly, the Wagyu beef short ribs were so so so amazing, I mean, I never wanted the taste to leave my mouth.

The next time I'm itching to get my island groove on, I'll do it right.  We'll grill chicken and burgers in the back yard, put the booze in the blender, light the Tiki torches, invite 20 or 30 people over and jam to Jimmy.  More fun to set sail to St. Somewhere in your own back yard than it is to have to endure the Glendale Margaritaville.

Shopee is a great platform to search for good bargains. But I need to warn that there are also a number of unscrupulous sellers who would purposely deliver to you a different item to what you ordered from them in order to achieve their sales even though they don't carry the product anymore.

"I've lived near Old Town Scottsdale for years and in all that time I've never really taken to the streets by foot, aside from a weekly visit to the Farmers Market. At first glance you ask yourself how many Indian jewelry shops can the area possibly sustain? Well the answer is, the turquoise market in Old Town seems to be doing quite well. So it was on a recent exploration trip that we happened upon David's Hamburger's and Mexican Food. So for me the idea of killer burger and tasty Mexican good is a match made in heaven, were talking major food groups here. 

Tucked between 2 galleries, David's is a blink and you'll miss it kind of place, very unassuming and humble. Inside you won't be wowed by the interior design but what they do have is functional and comfortable. With TV's at both ends of the hall like space, you'll be entertained by performance videos of 50's era rock 'n roll. 

I usually don't write much about soda pop, well never, but in this case the Cherry Coke ($1.95) was kind of special. When you order a Coke you can ask them to add a number of different flavorings from lemon and vanilla to chocolate and of course cherry. David's version is wonderfully fizzy and cuts through the richness of the upcoming meal. 

Of all the ways Mexican style meat is prepared, the grilled taste of beef is my all time favorite. If you enjoy this as much as I do then Id suggest the Carne Asada Nachos ($8.59). A massive pile of crunchy tortilla chips is covered in grilled beef strips, melted cheese, guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. While basic, I ate most of them myself leaving my partner to scraping the cheese off of the plate. If you'd like salsa on your chips, be sure to ask them to bring you bowls of green and red salsa. 

Now who doesn't like a big juicy hamburger? David's doesn't disappoint with David's Single ($5.99), say that 2 times fast. A 1/3lb patty topped with the usual suspects, then dressed with David's creamy sauce which to me was a thick version of Thousand Isle dressing, adding a layer of tangy goodness. Along side you have your choice of fries or you can choose to upgrade ($.99) to a mix of large deep fried onion rings and golden French fries. For dipping I a side of David's sauce did the trick in lieu of ketchup. 

The Patty Melt ($7.25) is classic diner food. We're talking thick ground beef patty, melted cheese and grilled onions on your choice of grilled sourdough or rye bread. The wholesome grease from the beef patty and grilled onions is absorbed into the bread creating a creamy like texture, for me this is what a patty melt is all about. Of course the Guacamole Burger ($6.25) with its pepper jack cheese, bacon and guacamole is the marriage of Mexican and American influence. 

If you're an early riser, David's also serves breakfast like Bacon Pancakes ($6.75) and Coconut Waffles ($6.25). Someone please pass the syrup.

"I entered the CPK world late in life, and I'm sad about it because, apparently, I've been missing out.  CPK is great!  Contrary to what I thought, it's not just a place for pizza.  Although the place can suit all sorts of tastebuds, I would recommend going JUST for the pizza.  I went this evening for the second time in two weeks and ordered the BBQ chicken chopped salad.  It maybe could've used a little more dressing, but it was still good, so I can't complain too much.  When I went last week, I ordered one pizza from the MANY great options available, and I have to say, there is a reason it is called the California PIZZA Kitchen and not the California SALAD or PASTA Kitchen.  So 'Yay!  I'm a fan.' of the PIZZA here.  The other stuff....meh.  

The servers are always pleasant here, and I never wait a long time for the food to come out.  Prices are what you would expect for a chain restaurant.  Parking isn't usually a problem unless there's an event going on at Tempe Marketplace.  The up-side to eating at this particular location is that you can browse the shopping area before you stop in or after you're done eating.

"I purchased a pair of Naot Paris sandals ($160 with tax) at The Shoe Mill.  I considered buying on-line, but decided to shop locally instead.  I ended up paying more, but assumed that I was paying for the superior service.  I wore my new shoes to work on Friday.  By the end of the day, I had developed blisters on both feet near my toes and my ankles.  I was surprised because I had read many reviews stating how comfortable Naot sandals are and the salesman who helped me confirmed that I was buying the correct size.  Sadly, I took them back to the store the next day.  To my surprise, I was told that The Shoe Mill does not take returns.  I have never tried to return shoes, so it didn't occur to me to ask this question when I made the purchase.  However, as I stated, I expected full service from a high end shoe store.

I was really disgusted with this place. I should have known when we walked in on Saturday at 12:30 PM and there was no one (not exagerating)  there.  But we were hungry and hot so we stayed. I wanted shrimp tacos but no shrimp at tacos del MAR...just frozen fish that you need to order 5 minutes ahead because they need to microwave it.   It's breaded and precut...couldn't they at least get the kind that has different shapes and looked like it wasn't completely processed?  The kids had bean burritos which they usually love anywhere but didn't like at all. My husband's chicken burrito tasted like a school cafeteria.  The clincher was that the unsweetened ice tea tasted rancid.  I think they let the tea bags go bad or something.  Gross and how annoying that they  don't have seafood.

"Of the 3 sites - this is the Kindergarten.

My daughter is attending here and I simply love it.  She's five and is repeating kindergarten.  She attended kindergarten last year early at the encouragement of her preschool teachers who thought she was bored in their classes.  We are having her repeat because she's a little young for first grade, but this isn't an issue because the curriculum rolls every two years for that very reason.  

In her first year - she learned to read, write, do simple math, know all her sign language letters, and has more Spanish knowledge than I do.  this year they will build upon all of that and take her further.

The staff is great and care a lot about the kids.  And when issues arise they  work with the parents to get them solved both at school and at home.

"My home airport, so with work travel, I'm passing through here very often. I prefer Terminal 4 because of the variety of eating/drinking options for pre-flight enjoyment, and 2 and 3 are just OK and don't offer so much in amenities... but they're less crowded and that is a nice plus.  Also, free wifi!

I rarely get lost in here and to be honest, security here has never been an issue... lines have been long going to gates in Term 4 but they move fairly quickly.

I don't do body-scans (my personal choice), so if you choose to do the same, when you put your crap in the conveyor belt and you note they are only doing body scanners, alert the TSA person and let them know you'll need a pat-down (or a groping.. feel-up.... whatever you wanna call it ;)).  Electing to do this takes me longer to get through security, but I prefer it and plan ahead.

Also, if you have a digital boarding pass on your iPhone or Android and go through a *different* gate (they are mostly all connected via runways, etc) due to the line at the gate you're supposed to go through, note that they may not be able to scan your digital boarding pass... this happened to us once when we went to another gate with a significantly shorter line.. luckily they had the kiosk just there so I ran out of line and printed them out while hubby held my spot.

"Wed-Sat, sit at the bar and ask for bartender JOY. She's a GAS!
Great spot for a late-afternoon glass of wine with an appetizer. Mostly poor execution from kitchen, excellent service.

--hummus appetizer with sample of olives is great choice
--crispy plantains with pepper are tasty and fun, crab dipping sauce, not enough crab
--tuna salad with arugula, uninteresting
--side salad for ciabatta ""sandwich"" typical Dole bag mix (first visit) was WILTED and nasty. Shame!
--chicken salad with dried tomatoes and goat cheese; way too much cheese

Now, to Joy. She's a keeper. First visit, we struggled with the proper preparation of a Sapphire martini, but it was primarily the fault of our server's communication skills. Working with machine-made ice (you know, the stuff with all the flecks and shards that water down a proper martini), she primed the ice with a squeeze of lemon, drained, then prepped the glass with vermouth, in and out, then pour the STIRRED Sapphire in, drop twist!

"Stumbled into this place while vacationing in Scottsdale for Spring Training. I was suffering from one of those hangovers that makes you feel your pulse in your dome. My buddy(who was campaigning for breakfast at Taco Bell..who does that?) was driving like a kamikaze pilot and responded to the vehicle full of people pointing towards Paradise and grunting uggghhh. While walking up to the door an odd brown dribble stain was pointing us towards the entrance. Didn't know what to make of this. Also wasn't sure if it was from my friends who had plodded in ahead of me. Once entering this fine establishment my not-so-working-correct brain couldn't comprehend the two different counters. Also confusing was the two menus. Being told what was going on by a nice gal behind the counter didn't help much since English was definitely my second language at this point in time. After just pointing at what I needed I was ushered along to the cash register. I got my number sat with my group and waited.....and waited......and waited. As more time passed I began to ponder what the actual construction and building time for a croissant sandwich was. Also helping was my wife reminding me of every person that got there food ahead of me. We were asked how are food was a couple of times so I figure they could sense my frustration as to not having it. Then my glorious croissant sandwich was brought to me. It tasted absolutely magnificent. I could have died right then and been happy. To make up for this delay the manager brought us THREE boxes of cookies.

"This go around I opted for the bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito (served all day!) and lengua (tongue), cabeza (head, and cheek meat), and carnitas (roasted pork) tacos.

"So I am an occasional shopper here at this market.. for a few reasons: we love their in-house made corn tortillas; they have a good selection of mexican treats (Bimbo breads and coconut bars) and if I'm buying conventional produce, their prices can't be beat.  Also, their pan Bolillo is really good and cheap and their cakes (3 Leches) are pretty damn good.

OK, so here is where the minus comes in.. the BIG minus.
My husband and I used to go occasionally for breakfast (I'd usually order simple, straightforward things like carne asada tacos.. don't get much simpler than meat in a corn tortilla).. well, the last time we did this, I found my meat... ready?... wait for it... to be the color blue and purple.  I had brown meat, but I had pieces of it that were blue and purple... no effin' joke.  I thought it was a trick of the eye, but I closely examined it and ... sho'nuff, that shit was blue and purple.  I immediately threw away my dish and never have I since ordered meat from their kitchen side.

That being said, I've also become more cautious in buying meats here... not to sound like a snob, but you bet I'm not buying my next cut of beef here!  I'm cool with their breads and their cakes and tortillas and such, but if it comes to meat, I'm out the door.

"This really amounts to 3.5 stars.  I think after seeing all of the stellar reviews combined with my LOVE for Filipino food, my expectations were just too high.

I took a few coworkers with me to check out the food and see if I had finally found a local Filipino eatery to curb my cravings.  Not so much.  The pancit (my favorite Filipino entree) seemed to lack flavor and/or seasoning.  I also wanted more meat and veggies - maybe that's just due to what I'm used to.  It was more just oily noodles and missed that flavor I wanted.  The good news is the pancit is cooked to order so it's very fresh and hot - just be prepared to wait a few minutes.

I was also very excited to get some lumpia.  Again, not so much.  They were tiny with some mushed ingredients in them.  Also again, it may be just what I am used to, but I've always had ones which are longer with more fillings - stuff you can actually see and taste what's in them.

On a positive note, the folks there are extremely friendly and helpful.  It makes me want to like it even more.  I'll go back and give it another go - I'll give the chicken adobo (my other favorite) a shot for some redemption.

A few tips:
*If you order pancit, order first because everyone's items are not brought out at once and the rest of your party will be waiting on you.
*It is a small place - tough to fit the 5 of us.  There were only a few other tables to seat 2.

"Stopped in on a whim. The whole plaza gives me the creeps (although I do like Yucca tap room and Capistrano's). But besides the plaza giving me the uneasy feeling, that even an unattractive mid-aged man could fall victim to a mid-day rape, I forged on. The rewards were less than stellar. I cruised the aisles of items looking for something I could purchase to add to my already cluttered abode. No dice. Everything is in that weird period, where it isn't old enough to be collectible, cool, or culturally relevant yet nothing is new enough to provide an upgrade. The only thing I thought was cool was a couple obscure punk CDs in the music section, but I already had the albums on my IPOD.

So after being thoroughly un-wowed by the Roosevelt row area, we decided to head back to our favorite old standby, Seamus.

"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more",updat novemb review year old kindl keyboard call newer model basic cheapi kindl kindl touch cours kindl fire quasi model excel choic whichev right depend prefer e ink kindl kindl keyboard kindl touch newest flagship model basic kindl exactli display sharp typefac high contrast read like ink paper eyestrain kindl keyboard oldest model got first one came august still absolut love kindl keyboard almost everi day dozen book like newer model neat featur experi read book better wors year old kindl keyboard page turn smoother faster newest kindl differ enough make worth cost upgrad opinion touch screen interfac kindl touch pretti neat unlik ipad kindl book read book nice current kindl model consid touch screen must featur normal obsess latest version everi tech product reason think cheapest kindl excel choic,0

We weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary.

I think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  

Dim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.

If you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.",grown hong kong eaten dim sum london ny la sf vancouv actual richmond confid say know dim sum good select well execut dim sum cart actual come around anyth left give star food wait definit detract whole experi think problem golden buddha handl heavi flow weekend enough regular dim sum eater like la sustain steadi flow diner throughout week forc restaur like golden buddha depend heavili extra part help weekend dim sum take seriou skill chef still end work look kitchen saw chines woman cook wonder took forev cart come swarm pack vultur will eat simpli decor place smaller menu highli recommend china chan much relax usual wait weekend experienc chef make dim sum menu much shorter classic anyth steam made order fresh,0

Some days they have very little selection of high quality clothing and other times I've seen $700 high-end designer dresses marked down to $30.

I somehow got on the Nordstrom mailing list, which I don't mind because they send postcards with the dates of these fashion events when new shipments arrive.

"Rolling Hills is two executive courses, and great for a quick cheap round of golf.  Totally not an out of towner destination course, but a nice little local fave of mine.  The front nine is the old course, and is a bit like mini-golfing, a fun distraction.  You even get to hear the occasional strange animal sound from the zoo hidden behind the trees along a couple holes.  The back nine is a newer build, and is way more challenging and scenic.  Either way they both give a fantastic view of the valley, and it's a great place to play a quick 9 holes after work in just over an hour

"Big fan of Hula's been a bunch of times, but finally was compelled to write a review.  Just came back from a week in Maui, so I was still in ""Hawaii-Mode"" (which is soooo hard to get out of lol), so I insisted we go to Hula's to get my Hawaii fix.  Mainly....that just means I was dying for a good Mai Tai.

If you go here, you MUST order a Mai Tai.  While most of their drinks are pretty good and tropical tasting, the Mai Tai is the best in town (now that Trader Vic's is donzo).  I'm a Mai tai snob, and cringe when most mai tai's here on the mainland are made way way way too sweet and fruity.  The Mai Tai at Hula's could rival some of the best in Hawaii in my opinion.  Mostly rum (white and dark) and just the right amount of sweet mixed with the right amount of tart/sour.  They go down great and they hit you with quite the kick before ya know it, so be careful ;-)!

As far as the food...its good, but its not Roy's so don't except anything amazing.  I usually get fish here, just to go with the whole Hawaiian thing.  Most of the times I've had Mahi, it can be dry sometimes, but always tastes good.  Ive had both the wasabi crusted and the macadamia nut crusted, both are decent.  The Luau Pork plate is darn good, but my recommendation is get the Luau Pork sandwich instead.  It goes so much better on bread, than just by itself.  All the appetizers are great to munch on while you're enjoying your Mai Tai...all thats missing is Hawaiian music, and the sun setting over the ocean :)",big fan hula bunch time final compel write review came back week maui still hawaii mode soooo hard get lol insist go hula get hawaii fix mainli mean die good mai tai go must order mai tai drink pretti good tropic tast mai tai best town trader vic donzo mai tai snob cring mai tai mainland made way way way sweet fruiti mai tai hula could rival best hawaii opinion mostli rum white dark right amount sweet mix right amount tart sour go great hit quit kick ya know care far food good roy except anyth amaz usual get fish go whole hawaiian time mahi dri sometim alway tast good ive wasabi crust macadamia nut crust decent luau pork plate darn good recommend get luau pork sandwich instead goe much better bread appet great munch enjoy mai tai that miss hawaiian music sun set ocean,0

"I own a roku and apple tv and have to say that the Amazon Fire TV falls into more of the apple tv category. It's definitely a walled garden of content that feeds you into amazon's prime tv offerings. You can access a lot of titles there for pay and often less expensively than On Demand options available from your cable provider.However, for your prime investment, there are no free titles. I'd love to see Amazon take a netflix model for a certain number of older titles. The price barrier keeps me from watching older titles, but the prices of latest releases are about average and worth it.The interface is great. I find the voice activation to be really accurate and easy to use. It's really how you are meant to navigate the massive number of options available.Performance is best in class as the Fire TV has a quad core processor that is unmatched by any other provider. I'd love to see a great game title arrive on the box that would make the game controller worth the investment. However, for an all-in-one, solution the game selection can definitely hit the spot.I use the plex and netflix apps available for this device and they perform great. Certainly, there's no blu-ray player that can match the capability of this device.All-in-all I definitely recommend this device to anyone, but still prefer the Roku since Roku isn't selling its own content service, so it agnostically serves a lot of free content that you didn't even know existed.",roku appl tv say fire tv fall appl tv categori definit wall garden content feed prime tv offer access lot titl pay often less expens demand option avail cabl provid howev prime invest free titl love see take netflix model certain number older titl price barrier keep watch older titl price latest releas averag worth interfac great find voic activ realli accur easi realli meant navig massiv number option avail perform best class fire tv quad core processor unmatch provid love see great game titl arriv box would make game control worth invest howev solut game select definit hit spot plex netflix app avail perform great certainli blu ray player match capabl definit recommend anyon still prefer roku sinc roku sell content servic agnost serv lot free content even know exist,0

The appetizers were mini pizza/bruschetta - some had mushrooms and some has tomatoes with cheese. Both were delicious. Another appetizer was a date wrapped in bacon - this was super delicious and easy to eat. I ordered a pineapple mojito and at first our server was confused, saying they don't have a blender but could make us a raspberry mojito. (I've had bartenders tell me they don't have blenders when I've ordered mojitos before, so I was used to this.) Luckily, our server came back later telling me she was confused and viola a delicious pineapple mojito was placed in my hands with a large slice of pineapple on the rim. It was amazing! So good, the husband had to order one for himself. Our party moved inside to a private room where we were given tiny menus with simple selections. The husband ordered the beef entree, steak with horseradish mashed potatoes and I ordered the scallops with corn polenta. While the scallops were delicious, the steak was super tender and moist! (Better than a fillet we had the night before!) For desert, I ordered the chocolate cake with coffee crema inside and the husband ordered the cheesecake.

"Delish! We drove around looking for a good steak without a wait and ended up at the Phoenician. With the restaurant concept by Jean Georges, we knew we were in for a treat. 

The only reasons I'm giving 4 stars are two-fold:

The shrimp cocktail was overpriced - $18 for 5 shrimp? C'mon...yummy but lame.

And

The desert menu is seriously lacking - I was expecting to see at least one amazing thing and they were all boring: cake, apple fritter, cheesecake, gelato...boring!!

Other than that, everything was amazing. I'm getting over a cold and they brought me out my own tea kettle which sat next to the table and stayed hot for two hours. And the finishing salt they provided in a tiny bowl was a great touch!

Order a steak, it'll be cooked perfectly with a great crust on it. Have them bring all the sauces too; their bernaise is ridiculously fluffy - they infuse it with liquid nitrogen!!  And the beurre blanc is perfect and delicate.

"I needed an oil change reeeeaaaally badly (i know, but i have a honda and those things can run on gas fumes for 30 miles and oil resin for months) and had had an OK experience at the danny's family on HIghland (free wash with a oil change, who doesn't love that?)

But. I checked the Danny's site and saw no promotion of the wash and didn't want to drive out of my way for nothing. i checked yelp and this Jiffy Lube had the best rating i could expect for an oil change place and was up the road from work. Downloaded the coupon (thanks for the tip, Kym) and was on my way.

Pull in and i tell the guy i want the ""Signature"" change which includes window wash and floor vacuum, mentioning my $5 off coupon. He said that they were already running a special that was $13 off the $35 price so i said a-ok, cowboy. 

i wait for about 8-10 minutes in the small waiting room (bonus for having a Phoenix Magazine in the stack of Muscle Car Monthly, Oil Today and Antennas Weekly - look, just because i'm getting routine maintenance on my car does not mean i'm INTO cars).

I get pulled into the garage area for the ""spiel"" everybody dreads but it was surprisingly short and non-pushy. (i'm glad they don't drag you over to your engine anymore, that's totally lame). i do have to note that he tried to tell me my right front blinker, my left back blinker and my license plate lights were out. i had JUST gone to Checker to replace my left front blinker light and went through some extensive light checking and so found this news odd. i kept saying as much, and he kept insisting and i was about to ask to see for myself when he calls out to another worker ""Hey, was that the honda with the lights or the jeep?"" the other guy says ""the jeep."" however, there was no other car in the place. hmmmmmmmm.

OK, so i pay up ($24 altogether with a tax or fee or something added in) and go back into the waiting area while they finish up. I decide to use the bathroom -- and this is where the they lost two stars (this was, up until then, quite possibly a four-star experience - wait, two stars for a bathroom, you ask? oh, you just wait...)

the bathroom was filthiest thing i have seen in my life, and i've been to some raunch truck stop pee holes. literally, piss, in the bowl... i get in closer and i shit you not (pun intended) four shit smears in the bowl as well (yeah, i counted). two rolls of TP hanging out on top of the dispenser, each with one square left on them. realizing i need to sterilize my hands from just walking into this mess, i discover no soap or paper towels (not very surprising). as well, hair clippings all over the sink, like the guys are trimming their moustaches on their break. un-freaking-believable. i am still haunted by this bathroom experience.

"Okay...this was very surprising since it was just voted Best Southwestern food in PHX mag's Best of the Valley issue...and thus, it made us want to have a visit.

I LOVE southwestern food...and I was very let down by this place.  I feel like I should give it 3 stars...but as an ""A-OK"" rating, I just can't.  If 3 stars were for ""OK food"" then I'd give it 3 stars.  But truly, I have...I have had better.

PHX Mag said to try the crab cakes, which we did, and they were delicious.  Very happy with them and therefore expected the entrees to be just as great...but they weren't.  : (  I had the salmon, which the waitress recommended and it was such a bummer.  It had way too many conflicting tastes going on that didn't seem to blend at all.  I lost my appetite after a few bites.  My boyfriend had the shrimp tacos which were just...average.  We were really disappointed.  

Again, the crab cake appetizer was great and the two margaritas were as well - the Tontorita and the Prickly Pear - both very, very yummy.  

But overall, if PHX Mag continues to recommend more lame-oid meals, I'm gonna have to start using it as wrapping paper instead of a go-to guide for great meals in this town.",okay surpris sinc vote best southwestern food phx mag best valley issu thu made us want visit love southwestern food let place feel like give star ok rate star ok food give star truli better phx mag said tri crab cake delici happi therefor expect entre great salmon waitress recommend bummer way mani conflict tast go seem blend lost appetit bite boyfriend shrimp taco averag realli disappoint crab cake appet great two margarita well tontorita prickli pear yummi overal phx mag continu recommend lame oid meal gonna start use wrap paper instead go guid great meal town,0

"Ate here months ago.  Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (don't quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue).  

One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempura'd chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.  I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I don't even recall what kind of roll I tried!  Pretty sad, I know.

"The Phoenix Art Museum was a day well spent. The atmosphere was inviting and it was like around every corner was a surprise waiting to be discovered. Admission was free for me. How you may ask? Our local library has cultural passes for various museums, try checking out your library next time you go. The museum was inexpensive adventure that took me across the world. 
 All the different exhibits kept me intrigued and interested. There were paintings, drawings, photography, and sculptures galore. There were even some animated pieces. I even stumbled upon a piece you could actually walk through. The layout of the museum is very easy to follow, as they give you a map and everything is labeled. You can go from the Asian culture, to English within a matter of feet. It is mind blowing. The whole world seems so much smaller, and it's brought together so beautifully. 
 They offer guided tours, or you can walk around by yourself. There is also a children's section to the museum. I have nothing bad to say about the museum itself. I am extremely happy that I went, and would recommend that anyone go. It would be a great date, or family day, or even a day by yourself.

"Summary: not impressed.

Arrived early afternoon, ironically maybe that was the problem - there wasn't enough going on, place was dead. I would have hoped that a restaurant manager would realize that the few customers they may have at a slow time are just as important as those on a Friday night rush - standards are standards, you either have them or you don't.

Waitress was pleasant but not attentive - with a total of 3 occupied tables had to get up and get her attention for more chips. Chips though were very good; needed hotter salsa.

My friend had the steak fajitas; tasted OK but just luke warm. Fajitas are supposed to be sizzling hot; duh.

I had a so-so tamale and chicken enchilada. Enchilada was just warm, mostly a flat layer of cheese. Tamale filling was tasty shredded meat (as it should be) but corn meal was barely warm and almost tasted only partially cooked. Refried beans weren't warm enough to even melt the grated cheese sprinkled on top, which consequently then pulled off in a single congealed mass when I took a bite. 

Finally, the Cadillac margaritas were just average at best. 

$50 plus tip for two meals plus two margaritas; not worth it.

The place looked promising and has a cute patio area but we won't be back - someone's not watching the store. I'm trying to be generous with the two stars as some other Yelpers seem to like this place; maybe things can get better.",summari impress arriv earli afternoon iron mayb problem enough go place dead would hope restaur manag would realiz custom may slow import friday night rush standard standard either waitress pleasant attent total occupi tabl get get attent chip chip though good need hotter salsa friend steak fajita tast ok luke warm fajita suppos sizzl hot duh tamal chicken enchilada enchilada warm mostli flat layer chees tamal fill tasti shred meat corn meal bare warm almost tast partial cook refri bean warm enough even melt grate chees sprinkl top consequ pull singl congeal mass took bite final cadillac margarita averag best plu tip two meal plu two margarita worth place look promis cute patio area back someon watch store tri gener two star yelper seem like place mayb thing get better,0

We had to ask the bartender if we could get a drink (That's odd) and all the wait staff acted like they were doing us a favor by waiting on us.

To top it all off, they had little to no air conditioning so it was brutal to sit through a combination of bad food, crummy service and high heat!!!

Cutting cost may not be a good thing to do when it comes to body care.  I won't be returning because I am concerned about health violations.

Pros:
Quick service
Cheaper than the spa, salon

Cons:
Improper cleaning of foot baths.  I thought they were good until I saw them seat a women at a used station.  They only took the sprayer and rinsed the dirty bowl.  (I did let her know)

The foot massage was more like a foot beating.  About an hour later my ankles felt like I had rolled them.  It took almost two weeks for them to feel normal again.

2) Buckhunt (the lil orange gun has even been taped together-double buck bonus!)
3) Bowling videogame...god, I love these things
4) Indoor smoking lounge!!! With a large screen TV, two tables and a lot of pleather seating, the large fan won't mean much but WOW-exciting! There is a french style door separating the lounge from the bar area where the stage is so you can still peak at the band while sucking tar.
5) Well...even the womens' bathroom is pretty gnarly...which would normally subtract a star-but I was so happy to pee in the unmarked restroom I won't touch it!

"The queso is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade tortillas are also outstanding.

Aside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!

We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.

We started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it.

We ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions).

Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be ""more than a pile of onions,"" that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.

So much potential, but it fails on almost everything. It's a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...

This time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that ""we're not dirty, it's just the food smell."" Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!

And the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out.

Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future.

IT was just HORRIBLE experience! 

I made an appointment for mani and pedi and came in Friday morning at 10 am. There was only one lady working there (no bage with her name) She said she could take me earlier than 10. I said it's fine, she asked me  to pay cash right away! only cash she said!! And ask me to go to ATM to get cash! I was surprised, but didn;t think anything bad. Later I realized that I didnt get any reciept so she just put my cash in her pocket because there were noone else there at that time.

She started with manicure and it took her less than 10 min!! everything was done in 10 min! She didnt even the nails, didnt remove the cuticule -she just polished the nailes with an old file. Her work was so nigligent in everything! Nail polish was all around the nails and my finger tips. I suggested her to correct it and remove an extra polish around and she did it only on few nails, repeating all the time :""Pretty? Yes?"" It was so far from looking pretty!

I'm a polite person by nature and never argue, but here it was just awful! And I payed her first together with the tips so she took 45 bucks from me

Her pedi was not better at all!! She was always in a hurry! She didnt let my nails  dry and started putting my shoes on me! I warned her that it must have been not done yet, but she didnt listen, she wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible, so all the nails went messy!!! She reapplied the polish but the whole procedure was just so frustrating!! I left the place more than just upset-I was really mad!  

The next day the nail polish started to chip off on every other finger! OMG! I wanted to cry! It's the worse mani and pedi I've ever gotten in my entire life, and I do it every month!!

"Really mixed feelings here. Met a friend here on a Thursday about 6:45. Place was busy, but we were able to get seated immediately as it wasn't totally full, and even being not at capacity, it was insanely loud. Naturally I expect a beer bar to have a relatively high volume but this place was ridiculously loud to the point of being annoying.

The beer selection was good though I'm not sure that makes up for the loudness and atmosphere that seemed a bit off: really brightly lit, and the decorating was of the signs-bought-new-but-made-to-look-old variety. Almost like a Bennigan's, kind of fakey-like. And why oh why does a place that specializes in beer and seats so many people have just a single urinal and single stall in the tiny men's bathroom? I hate standing in line to pee but than again maybe I'm just getting old :D (as an aside, obviously I have no experience using the women's so can't address that, sorry ladies)

I'll try it again though. Food was OK, not great. Probably won't be a regular hangout since it's not close by to where I live and it didn't seem worth going out of the way for considering how many other beer bars/breweries there are around the city with better atmosphere.",realli mix feel met friend thursday place busi abl get seat immedi total full even capac insan loud natur expect beer bar rel high volum place ridicul loud point annoy beer select good though sure make loud atmospher seem bit realli brightli lit decor sign bought new made look old varieti almost like bennigan kind fakey like oh place special beer seat mani peopl singl urin singl stall tini men bathroom hate stand line pee mayb get old asid obvious experi use women address sorri ladi tri though food ok great probabl regular hangout sinc close live seem worth go way consid mani beer bar breweri around citi better atmospher,1

"Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen is a gem in the many pizza locations that can be found in the Phoenix area.  Picazzo's boasts a menu which includes appetizers, salads, organic and gluten-free pastas, and of course pizza and dessert!  One cannot go wrong with any of the categories of foods Picazzo's offers, but there are certainly favorites that can be ordered upon ones first visit.  

Picazzo's offers a casual yet sophisticated atmosphere upon entering their establishment.  One is greeted immediately by their hostess at the door and then you are seated promptly at one of their many tables (or the bar area if you prefer).  The atmosphere is roomy with their ample seating, and friendly upon entering.

One of their best appetizers is their Mama's Meat-za Balls ($9.50).  Made with three meatballs with mozzarella, artichoke hearts, organic tomato sauce, basil, and Parmesan, it is a savory appetizer that easy starts the meal off on the right foot. 

One can choose from one of their many pasta dishes or their pizza creations, or even create your own creation.  If going with one of their creations, I would recommend their ""Nonna's Favorite"" (gluten free) ($16.50, $21.00, $25.00).  This pizza is a delicious combination of organic olive oil and garlic, Fontina and mozzarella cheeses, mushrooms, tomatoes, goat cheese, Kalamata olives, and basil. Melts right in your mouth and one can easy eat more than one expected! 

If even after all of this you still crave something sweet - One cannot go wrong with electing their ""Classic Chocolate Chip Skillet Cookie"" ($7.00).  This sinful combination includes two scoops of organic vanilla bean or coconut vanilla ice cream served with your choice of organic chocolate, chocolate mint, or chocolate raspberry sauce over a fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie.  Oh wondrous dessert indeed!

"Oh, how I miss this Goodwill store, which opened in September 2011. I moved to North Carolina in March 2012, and have not been able to find anything like it here. Large, clean, and very well organized, this store is thrift shop heaven. And it's all for a good cause: there's a job center right on site that helps people find work. Go on Thursdays, if you can, when a designated tag color is just $1. I've purchased a lot of name brand clothing here for $1 per piece. You can also check out certain Saturdays when everything in the store is half price. I got a great mirror that matched the dresser in my guest bedroom for $12.50.

"Thank you, Mobile Yelp App!  Without you, I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea of where to find Thai food for lunch that was near a Light Rail station in Tempe!

I arrived at Thai Rama about 11:15 AM.  On entering, there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff, so I selected a table and sat down.  My waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a 2-seat table instead of the 4-seat table I had selected.  Since there were about 25 available tables of various size, I declined and told her I was comfortable where I sat.  There were 3 other tables active in the restaurant, so I did not anticipate the restaurant needing my 4-top before I was done.

The waitress set the lunch specials menu on the table and went to get a glass of water.  The lunch specials menu had 10 options available, but no Som Tom.  I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom.

I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water.

Ambience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day.

About 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.  

Jasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important!

On completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out.

For the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long.",thank mobil yelp without would stuck phoenix idea find thai food lunch near light rail station temp arriv thai rama enter indic wait serv visibl staff select tabl sat waitress came tabl ask would comfort seat tabl instead seat tabl select sinc avail tabl variou size declin told comfort sat tabl activ restaur anticip restaur need top done waitress set lunch special menu tabl went get glass water lunch special menu option avail som tom ask waitress som tom avail answer know som tom reach full menu explain som tom green papaya salad hand menu direct third page salad first list som tom order som tom yardstick measur everi thai restaur spici make nose run make forehead sweat bring tear eye leav green bean shrimp jasmin rice waitress ask want anyth els drink said would stick water ambienc pretti plain paper napkin highest qualiti decor remind formula type restaur like applebe chili hispan flair observ chef came kitchen made loop around dine room walk ask thai stop repli day start slow would busi soon enough continu back kitchen wish good day minut later papaya salad brought tabl portion size nice cup took tast evalu spici waitress came ask need anyth ask chili lime return quickli red chili pepper slice lime doctor order fell gusto price adequ jasmin rice cup sticki waitress good keep water glass full phoenix import complet lunch sat wait waitress bring bill saw minut chef came kitchen made anoth round dine room ask english enjoy salad answer thai spici enough surpris use red chili instead thai chili chuckl repli thai chili littl expens ask check said would send waitress conveni outstand next experi sure chef see place order wait bill littl long,0

"I was really looking forward to using what was hyped as an amazing piece of entertainment equipment, but the actual experience falls short.Pros:+ User interface and underlying hardware is fast+ Form factor of the device and remote control is very sleek+ Plays games fairly well, especially for such a small box+ Quality of Amazon videos is very good+ Voice search works quite well+ The device came pre-configured for my Amazon account. I just plugged it in, updated the software, and away I wentCons:- First and foremost, there is STILL no way to search for only free movies on Prime.- Amazon touts it's 40,000 Prime movies available, but good luck finding them. There is no categorization by genre. You are stuck surfing through dumb lists of movies, or using the search function, which almost never returns any Prime movies- Voice search works only on Amazon content. You cannot use this to search within Netflix, for example- The Amazon FireTV box only comes with 8GB of memory for game and app storage, which is completely inadequate. There are games available for download that consume almost 2GB for ONE GAME. Good luck downloading a 1.76GB game, like the racing game featured in the list of top games.Clearly, Amazon is marketing this device as a way to push its video content. In the help video that automatically plays the first time you use the device, it even offers you a 30 day Prime membership for free to try it out. However, Amazon has no incentive to help you actually search for and find this free content. It's clearly evident in the lack of ability to filter search results on free Prime content only. This is my biggest beef with Amazon, by far. I want a Netflix-like experience, where my Prime content is sorted by genre, and I can search for free movies only. Now, if you want to pay for video rentals, by all means buy this device, because it works really well. If you want it to access your Prime content only, stick to the Roku box you probably already have, because it works just as good.UPDATE:I called customer service, and talked to a guy about how I can search for and access my 40,000 Prime movies. Well....YOU CAN'T According to him, I can only find the Prime movies on the two lists on FireTV that say Recently added to Prime and Top Prime Movies. Those lists are 73 items, and 150 items, respectively. THERE IS NO WAY TO SEARCH OR BROWSE FREE PRIME CONTENT ONLY. The guy I talked to said this was a very common request for people. OF COURSE IT IS. I don't want to pay for video rentals if I just paid for a Prime membership to access free content. AMAZON COMPLETELY FAILED.

"The sign also bills itself as 'Santa Fe style' food. Having lived many years in New Mexico, with a family - generations of which are from New Mexico - the cuisine was decidely not New Mexican. It was standard Sonoran.

With that said, the meal was quite enjoyable. The enchilada sauce had a nice flavor. The dulce de leche was fantastic. The service was very good. The decor was a little non-descript, but that's OK, All in all, a nice addition to the meager choices for Mexican food in Surprise.  We would probably come back.

I had to give it 3-stars because of what it is not. If you are looking for Spanish food - there is none here. If you are looking for New Mexican style-cuisine, you won't find it either.

"I was NOT too impressed with this place but...  it was good for Phoenix, where I am starting to realize there is NOT an abundance of people who look like me.  =/   LOL! 

Flavor-wise I thought it was pretty good.  Don't be misled by the spring rolls...  Even though it says they serve them in 3s...  its 3 that are cut in half...  so you get 6 pieces.  This is pretty good if you're looking to share with someone.  I did not get a lot of lettuce and mint, though and ate the last two pieces by themselves.  I was a little disappointed by this.

I had the combination Pho...  (YES i braved SOUP it in HOT ASS ARIZONA) and it was not too bad either.  The broth was nice and clear, just portion wise...  was not as extra large as I expected it to be.

When the bill came, I ended up paying about $18 total which included tax and tip and no drink.  I think the Pho was almost $10.00 and the Spring Rolls were like $4 and some change?

I think this place is cool but would not be my FIRST choice when it comes to pho.  (Trust me...  I've eaten a LOT of pho)  I just don;t think the price vs. portion is worth what you;re paying.  This saddens me to say too because, I am ALL about supporting small Asian businesses.

"CARLOS O'BRIENS IS MEXICAN FOOD!  Sorry for yelling but I nearly dropped my phone when I started reading reviews from people expecting Irish fare.

I've been eating at Carlos for 22 years or so.  I remember being quite young going to the 12th Street and Northern Location.

They have, hands-down, the best Pollo Fundito Chimi I have ever eaten, and boy have I eaten my fair share.  5 stars

Their chips and salsa are also always fresh.  The chips get also 5 stars.  Always fresh and hot.  

Their mild salsa is very mild and watery.  Not my style but it fresh.  I mix the hot in with the mild which works form me.

Shredded beef tacos are also 5 stars.  Love 'em.

Fried ice cream is also yummy.  I'm not a desert guy so I won't attach stars to them but yum yum.

Other tips are to come at happy hour.  Good deals.  Lunch specials and portions are just right also.

Carlos O'Brien's is a great place that just gives me comfort knowing that it is there when I need it.  I spend so much time trying new places, especially mexican, that this old favorite tends to get skipped because the closest one is 15 miles from the house.

to make a long story short --- we had a coupon for this place.  We know its an ASU hang out but the coupon was for spend 50.00 get 25.00 off.  Ok service was not good --- when we got the bill the pizza and wings were charged separate -- not right -- it was a together order per the menu.  We had a pitcher of beer and a single beer plus food -- bill was almost 70.00 -- we gave the waitress the coupon -- she had to change the bill for the pizza and wings --- then she came back and stated the coupon had a 18% gratuity and service charge of 13.59.  Based on what ???  that actually ate up the coupon and we ended up paying full price anyway.

"This place is sweet. They are not big on china, glassware or silverware. They use recycled products plates, plastic-ware and drinks in the container they come in (ie a coke in a coke can). The ambiance is awesome. Sweet and funny signs everywhere, reading material, classic rock playing. They only have the radio on but there always seem to be great songs on! They have a large patio out back that is difficult to see from the front but is really nice on a sunny morning. 

I haven't gotten past the breakfast bowls yet. $6 for 6 toppings, potatoes, buttered toast, and jam. Go ahead and eat carnivore, omnivore or herbivore style (not sure if there are vegan options). Seriously, this $6 breakfast bowl would be $12 at other places served on fine china and with silverware! I don't care about accoutrements like that. Especially when the food is so tasty.

"We went there for the first time recently and was pleasantly surprised. We got there about 8pm on a Friday night and the place was still packed. We only waited maybe 5 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad at all. 

My date had the BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side salad. While we were waiting for his salad to come out the server came over and said there was a mistake as he should have already receive his salad and it would be right up, which it was so not a huge deal. A few minutes later our meals came out. While he was hoping it was shredded chicken it was a chicken breast but said it was still quite tasty. I had the 10oz rib eye with sides of green beans and applesauce. The steak was cut perfectly and it was a perfect size portion. The green beans (which the server suggested) were awesome and the applesauce was a nice sweet finish so no dessert was needed. Another bonus is everything (steak, beans, applesauce) were all served on separate plates so no runny juices mixing all over the place which was perfect!!!! 

The prices were very reasonable as well. 

Overall, we both enjoyed Texas Roadhouse and will certainly be back.",went first recent pleasantli surpris got pm friday night place still pack wait mayb minut get tabl date bbq chicken sandwich side salad wait salad come server came said mistak alreadi receiv salad would right huge deal minut later meal came hope shred chicken chicken breast said still quit tasti oz rib eye side green bean applesauc steak cut perfectli perfect size portion green bean server suggest awesom applesauc nice sweet finish dessert need anoth bonu everyth steak bean applesauc serv separ plate runni juic mix place perfect price reason well overal enjoy texa roadhous certainli back,0

I also tried a chocolate mini cupcake.  Yummy.  Again, moist and delicious.  I don't know how they keep the mini ones from drying out.

"This is the best record store in Tempe, hands down.  Second best in the Valley (after Tracks in Wax).  

I have been collecting records for almost 30 years now, and have been going to Eastside for about half that time - at least since I could conveniently drive out to the east valley, and regularly since I moved to this end of town about 10 years ago.  I remember the fish tank with the moray eel and the fact that the plaza they are in used to let them have twice the space.

It amazes me that they have survived all this time.  And, boy, am I glad they have.  A good chunk of my collection, and even my current turntable, has come from here.  

If I ever won the lottery, I would probably spend enough money in one day here to keep the place in business for another few decades.  Heck, I'd even buy them a bigger place if I could!  This is one of the last truly independent record stores.  I'm happy to support them, and I hope everyone else will continue to do so as well.

"I would give this place NO STARS but Yelp! wants me to give at least one. 

I went here with my boyfriend last night for dinner and next to our awful Bucca di Beppo (Scottsdale) experience, I have to say, this one is on my list of MOST TERRIBLE restaurant experiences. The service was so bad, we didn't even get to try the food! 

True Yelper that I am, I did my homework before suggesting that we come here for dinner. I saw all the reviews about the ""bad service"" , but I paid more attention to the ""Cheap"" and  ""Delicious Pho"" reviews because after all, you can't knock it til you've tried it. Yes, the place looks as divey as any food dive gets, yes the place isn't as clean as it probably can be, but hey, all the best pho I've  had (Da Vang, Khai Hoan, Pho Thanh) has been from some of the diviest pho spots in town.  I was excited. 

It was around 6pm and the place wasn't busy (there were 5 other customers besides us, and 3 of them were on their way out), so we went ahead and sat ourselves down. The server gave us menus, and made her way back behind the cash register. 

After looking over the menu for less than 2 minutes (I usually go for the spring rolls + everything pho whenever I visit a new spot), we were ready to order. I tried to make eye contact with our server but she seemed to be preoccupied with laughing and talking with the pre-teen sitting behind the counter with her. I finally made eye contact with her, she looked at me and I looked at her, and she turned back to her conversation. For the next 15 minutes I tried to get her attention to alert her that we were ready to order - no luck. But then I noticed that both her and the girl she was talking to were looking over at us and laughing, occasionally pointing in our direction and laughing some more. I wasn't about to give up because I was determined to try some of their well-reviewed food, but after a quarter of an hour spent trying to get their attention with them just laughing and pointing at us, my boyfriend and I had enough. The way they treated us was disrespectful and humiliating, so we walked out and drove across town to another Vietnamese restaurant. 

We are never going back to this restaurant, and I suggest you don't either. Just as it isn't acceptable for customers to be rude to restaurant staff, it also isn't okay for restaurant staff to be blatantly rude to customers who have not done anything to deserve bad treatment. We did not deserve the type of treatment we got at this restaurant and I am seriously fuming with anger as I write this review. I don't care how delicious and cheap your food is, you cannot use that as an excuse to make customers who come in feel like somehow they are undeserving individuals. 

Thanks, but no thanks, Pho House. I don't need to feel disrespected and belittled just so I can try your cheap Vietnamese food. I have plenty of Vietnamese friends who have moms who can probably cook better than you can and will treat us a million times better than your staff did last night.",would give place star yelp want give least went boyfriend last night dinner next aw bucca di beppo scottsdal experi say list terribl restaur experi servic even get tri food true yelper homework suggest come dinner saw review servic paid attent cheap delici pho review knock til tri ye place look divey food dive get ye place clean probabl hey best pho da vang khai hoan pho thanh diviest pho spot town excit around pm place busi custom besid us way went ahead sat server gave us menu made way back behind cash regist look menu less minut usual go spring roll everyth pho whenev visit new spot readi order tri make eye contact server seem preoccupi laugh talk pre teen sit behind counter final made eye contact look look turn back convers next minut tri get attent alert readi order luck notic girl talk look us laugh occasion point direct laugh give determin tri well review food quarter hour spent tri get attent laugh point us boyfriend enough way treat us disrespect humili walk drove across town anoth vietnames restaur never go back restaur suggest either accept custom rude restaur staff also okay restaur staff blatantli rude custom done anyth deserv treatment deserv type treatment got restaur serious fume anger write review care delici cheap food cannot excus make custom come feel like somehow undeserv individu thank thank pho hous need feel disrespect belittl tri cheap vietnames food plenti vietnames friend mom probabl cook better treat us million time better staff last night,1

"In the office, Fiesta Burrito is aptly known as ""across the street.""  Kind of like, ""How about across the street?""  ""Yeah, I could do across the street, today.""  If I ever said, ""How about Fiesta Burrito?""  I would get, ""Where's that?""  Then I would have to say, ""You know, across the street.""  And the response would be, ""Well, why didn't you say so in the first place.""

The primary reason we eat at ""across the street"" is because it is convenient - it's across the street.  And in the immortal words of my most quotable co-worker, ""It is fast, cheap, and good -- no questions asked.""  The part about it being good is debatable.  I could do with a little less greasy.  Fast, no question.  And despite that fact that ""across the street"" charges 60 cents for spicy carrots now, the prices are low.  I like the chorizo plate with a side of sour cream, although I might start branching out as we eat at ""across the street"" way too much, and I'm getting tired of always having the same thing.

At just above a dive, I would call it a hole in the wall, but really, it is just a generic Mexican joint that hides in plain sight.  Even the name is rather plain as no one can seem to remember it.  There is a smallish, generic inside dining area, which is accompanied by a small, generic patio for outside dining.  Some high school students seem to come by for lunch leave.  The staff is polite.

"I was looking into gyms around the area. Upon entering I was greeted by the front desk guy. I asked about memberships and then he said, ""Sorry we are sold out"". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered, ""Just kidding"". Trying to be a good sport I went with it. 

Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying, ""Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,"". In other words, no straight answers. 

We sat at the sales guy's desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. ""If you choose option A, you then can go to all the gyms."" ""If you choose option B, then only here"" . The whole time I could see the children's area and the kids were being completely ignored (and we are talking very little children). When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde routine. ""Well you only have today to make a decision, after that no price guarantee!!!""   From there he was down right rude.

I walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened. Like Sarah G, I felt horrible when I left this gym.  It was an awful experience.

I was expecting more since there are so many 5 star reviews on yelp. Three friends and I tried Rokerij for the first time on Saturday. We had a reservation for 6:30. The specials are on a blackboard above your head behind you if you are seated in the booths. You have the practically get out to read them. The paper menus have a lot of abbreviations so you have to keep remembering what the letters mean. I don't want to work that hard. Can't you just spell out the words? I ordered the surf and turf from the Richardson's side of the menu. What was delivered was an unappetizing mess. The plate and everything on it was covered in a chili sauce. It looked like dog food with a piece of steak in the middle. Really it was a terrible presentation. My husband's plate looked the same. The other two at our table ordered from the Rokerij side and at least it looked a lot better. The two bacon wrapped shrimp were flavorful and my steak was over cooked for medium but OK. I could have skipped the messy beans or at least they could put them in a cup.

"I don't know what's up with Eddie??? I always found him to be pleasant, and really taking care of the customers. However on the 17th of November we had a birthday party of 19 people, and they gave us one waitress. We sat down at 7:00 pm and our main course came at 9:15. No real big deal but one person can't handle a table of 19, and we were having fun. So one of the guest's had ordered the $12.00 burger along with a salad and told the waitress no Mayo because he can't stand it at all. The burger comes out and it has Mayo on it, and he tells the waitress. She was not at fault, and had written it down clearly. He asked for a new one, and she comes back and say's Eddie cooked the hamburger and refused to cook a new one but would make him a new bun. He didn't want that because he hates Mayo that much, so there was no problem taking it off the tab, but Eddie would not make a new one. LOL. What's up Eddie??? I don't understand at all, you take it off the bill because you screwed up, but refuse to make another burger that you would have been paid for.  Then you end up looking like a fool in front of the other eighteen people. My daughter has even taken one of your classes, and said what a great guy you are.

I could just eat the crust and forget the fish. 

We've been twice now and I'm sad to say that we pretty much ordered the same things twice.

"LOVE it here. I stay at hotels about 80 nights a year for work, and often go to Phoenix. Gotta say, if it weren't for the ""hood"" neighborhood, I would've given it 5 stars. The restaurant next door, Bobby Q, has rave reviews, so it seems like a convenient place to eat, but that seems to be the only dinner place around. Good thing it's the Residence Inn, with a small kitchenette.

This is probably the cleanest hotel I've stayed in all year. The dishes and silver wear are very clean and housekeeping keeps it that way daily. I've stayed at places twice the amount of this Residence Inn in Scottsdale and dishes in the kitchenette were filthy.

Elephant Thai is a good thai place with a varied menu, freshly made food, and nice atmosphere.

I don't remember them being bad or great...but my husband likes corn a lot, and I think he enjoyed them more than me. The green papaya salad was as close  in flavor to the papaya salad we had freshly made for us on the beaches of Thailand as I'd expect around here. We also had the thom ka soup which was really tasty. It was a while ago, so I can't remember the entrees we got. I probably got the pad thai...just to try it, and some kind of meat dish. I definitely don't remember anything being awful...and although it might not have been exceptional food, it was enjoyable. Thai ice tea was yummy, and my husband had the limeade which was too tart for me, although he thought it was really sweet and quite good.

The ambiance is slightly different than the other locations but I think that is mostly due to the fact that two sides of the restaurant are glass.

"This place is a gem. The food is amazing. It's cheap. The service is good. My favorite part? The place never changes. I can walk through the door and Ali already knows my order. The Chicken Shawarma special comes with their hand-made pita - so soft and delicious. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and comes with a yummy little dollop of garlic sauce. I've never found better hummus in my life. I've had it all around town, in New York, in L.A. (ick...L.A. *shudder*). SO good! The iced tea has a hint of rose water. OH and the gyro? Hands down, the best in town.

Did I mention they have a market attached? Talk about the best price on spices in town! The spices come in little plastic sealed pillows, so get some spice jars from Ikea and stock up!

I couldn't get through this without mentioning the lamb tongue. I am no connoisseur of organ meats, but this sandwich is like the most tender lamb you've ever had in your life. Shut up and try it.

"This is my second Kindle, I also have a 3G Kindle touch, and of the two, I prefer the touch overall.Features I like about the Fire: I love and hate the carousel all at the same time. I love how easy it is to scan through the books that I have on my Kindle and seeing the pictures of the covers (because sometimes I like to pick my books based solely on the cover). I don't like how every book I purchase shows up on the carousel whether I've sent it to the Fire or not (there may be a way to stop that from happening, but I haven't figured it out yet if there is.)I really like having my Fire connected to my Goodreads account so that when I finish reading a book on the Fire and write a review for Amazon, it also posts to Goodreads for me without any extra work on my part.I also like being able to read on my Fire without an additional light source.I do not like the glare on the screen while trying to read in sunlight. For me, the Fire has been basically useless anywhere that sunlight is involved, which includes car rides on sunny days as the sun shining through the car windows creates too much glare to read.

"Wow, what a blast from the past!  I hadn't eaten at a Sizzler since it was popular in '80s, so when we saw that they opened up again where Taco Tote used to be, we had to go and check it out!

When we walked in, it was like reliving my childhood, when we went to Sizzler as a special dinner, to gorge on the salad buffet and the unlimited fried shrimp.  Seeing that the salad bar itself was $8.99, and that for only a dollar more I could get a half dozen of fried shrimp, I figured I might as well!  The shrimp comes with your choice of side: either some incarnation of potato (fries, baked, etc.) or veggie (Such as steamed broccoli).  The shrimp looked just how they did in the '80s, pounded then battered and fried.  They were decent, nothing too special, but not bad.

The salad bar has various salad greens, toppings, and dressings to choose from.  There's also an area with cold shrimp and halved avocados.  I was excited to see that they had such high quality items, but unfortunately the execution was something left to be desired.  The shrimp was deheaded, but whole, so if you wanted de-veined shrimp you had to de-vein them on your own.  The shrimp was also overcooked, and a bit tough as a result.  The avocado was a nice touch, but unfortunately many of them were slightly under ripe, so they tasted a little sponge-like rather than creamy.

The hot foods section along the corner area of the buffet has items such as buffalo wings, meatballs in marinara sauce, and a taco bar.  There are also desserts here, like brownies, bread pudding, and soft serve ice cream with various toppings to choose from.  The taco bar was probably the best part of the hot bar.  There are various outer shells to choose from (Tostada, hard taco shell, soft tortilla, taco salad bowls), 2 meats (Ground beef and carnitas), and veggies (Such as pico de gallo, jalapenos, guacamole, cheese, lettuce).  There's also gooey nacho cheese and refried beans at the counter.  The carnitas was probably the best out of all the taco toppings.  It was slow cooked, and had a rich, deep smoky flavor.  

Service was good, drinks were refilled and dirty plates were removed as needed.

"I have the original Nvidia Shield TV (not the latest 2017 version) and as such, I also have the older/bulkier controller that it came with. While it works alright, I was never that happy with it just because it's so large and clunky (I have smaller hands) and never got all that comfortable with it. So, I went searching for a replacement controller to use with it...Along came the 2017 Shield TV and a newly revamped controller. Looks nice, got good reviews, but at this time, almost impossible to find one new or used for under 50 which is a bit more than I wanted to pay for a controller.I found the Amazon Fire TV controller searching around and wondered if it would work with the Shield. Turns out that the AFT controller is NOT bluetooth, but rather, Wi-Fi direct. Did a little more research and a few random searches led me to believe that you could indeed use this controller with a Shield TV.Since it's not bluetooth, trying to pair this controller with the Shield (or any other bluetooth device) is impossible. But, at the suggestion of someone on an Nvidia forum, if you go into the Shield's settings and go to the add Shield Accessory setting, while holding the home button on the AFT controller, after a few moments, indeed, it does connect and it does work. It doesn't show up as a Shield accessory (since technically, it's not) so it's kinda weird that way. Nowhere will you see in the Shield's settings or options that the controller is even connected.After connecting or pairing the AFT controller with my Shield I noticed that I lost all sound and audio. The AFT controller microphone works, but it basically caused me to lose all sound on my Shield. Needless to say that bummed me out.Read more",origin nvidia shield tv latest version also older bulkier control came work alright never happi larg clunki smaller hand never got comfort went search replac control along came shield tv newli revamp control look nice got good review almost imposs find new use bit want pay control found fire tv control search around wonder would work shield turn aft control bluetooth rather wi fi direct littl research random search led believ could inde control shield tv sinc bluetooth tri pair control shield bluetooth imposs suggest someon nvidia forum go shield set go add shield accessori set hold home button aft control moment inde connect work show shield accessori sinc technic kinda weird way nowher see shield set option control even connect connect pair aft control shield notic lost sound audio aft control microphon work basic caus lose sound shield needless say bum,1

"Flatiron Mesa is one of my favorite hikes in the Phoenix area. Like other reviewers have stated, once you've gotten used to Squaw and Camelback, give this one a try.  It'll kick your ass.

I'd say give yourself about 5 hours to go up and down.  It's inside Lost Dutchman State Park so you will need to pay an entry fee.

My one recommendation besides the obvious ones (being fit, pack food and water) is to bring some light gloves.  Since you're climbing up and down on all those boulders your hands will probably get a little scratched up.

"""Fuck you all, we hope you die.
That's the Trojan Battle Cry!""
Wow, I can not believe someone Yelp'ed PV. 
 My freshman year, my science teacher was arrested from embezzling from the strip joint she owned. We then had a different teacher every couple of weeks for the first half of the year. When we finally got a permanent teacher, the damage was done. The kids had no connection or respect for any teacher who walked in the door anymore.
  The year I graduated, there were 3000 students and over 1000 in my graduating class. We often had 40+ kids in one classroom. 
Man, I hated this school. When I first started on the Bell Rd Campus, we referred to it as PV Prison because of the tall, iron, spiked gates and security in golf carts patrolling the campus for potential escapees. I remember, before they briefly closed the campus for renovations, a girl falling through the auditorium wall, and pieces of the ceiling falling on peoples heads before they condemned it. After 2 years at this location, they suddenly closed the campus and opened the new campus on Union Hills, the campus that was to become North Canyon.
 They built the new campus with the intention of having both schools open, but as more and more buildings kept falling apart, they decided to shut down PV and re-open it under the same name on the new campus. 
 They spent a shit-ton fuck load of money on a super high-tech theater, in return for letting it be used for official Gov't events,  that no one new how to use. This was one of the best things about it. I was one of the few people who could run the sound and lights and got out of class frequently because of it. 
 I remember making a video with Casey about an art show the school was having and not being allowed to air it on the morning video announcements because we used the phrase ""come out of the closet"" and they thought the phrase might be offensive. Then, that same week, the football team had a video where they all pretended to be gay, talking with lisps and flailing limp wrists. When I went to the office to ask what the fuck, they told me that football players didn't need approval for anything they did. I remember my friend being expelled for missing too much school due to chicken pox and a mother not well enough to call her in. I, of course, seemed invisible to the system. I ditched class often, and it never showed on my record at all. I remember when Miss Lee dressed as a hard rocker with tattoo's for halloween and the administrators making her change it because the costume was a bad influence. I remember my friends boyfriend being suspended because they searched his car for drugs (on an anonymous tip) and found a box cutter in his trunk he used for work which he kept in his trunk because he went to work straight from school.  I remember testing out of highschool classes before freshman year, yet being subjected to 4 years of bullshit. I am pretty sure it was PVUSD that was the inspiration for the movie ""Pump Up the Volume"", which was filmed in the general area.
  When I quit the softball team, the coach/school councilor kept sending people to pull me out of class to try to talk me into playing again. When we took pictures for the badminton team, we didn't have enough uniforms for the entire team. 
 I felt like I was in some prison or some high security mental facility. In fact, when my mom visited the new campus, she was horrified there were no windows and they used the drab, grey/blue colors they use in mental hospitals she had worked in to keep the patients calm. I never had a chemistry class. My two history classes consisted of a teacher who spent one entire year talking about Shakespear, and another who said that ""The slaves did not have it so bad"".  My Biology book was so old, it had my friends mothers name in it from 20 years earlier, AND same friends mother warned me against my Biology teacher, Mr. H__. ""If he ever tells you to stay after class by yourself.. DON'T.""  
 
The Good Things I Remember -
 Mrs. Toal [sp?], a very good, and supportive, English teacher. Miss Lee, the best photography/video teacher ever and always had the best Halloween costumes. Hanging out at lunch under a tree with the boy we called Rico Suave who said he lived in a box and would tell stories about the Horny Lady. Sneaking off campus to go to Barrows Pizza. My friends  wearing cut out Trojan condom boxes pinned to their shirt at the forced ""spirit assemblies"" and chanting our own spirit chant of ""Fuck you all we hope you die, that's the Trojan battle cry"".

 Time has a way of blurring the past, and making it less icky. Yet, my sister is a teacher at North Canyon, and a few years back I went and visited her on campus. The second I stepped into the main building, I felt sick to my stomach. Literally. 
 I hear they have made improvements since I graduated, and I hope so. I don't want my niece and nephew forced to survive another drone factory.",fuck hope die trojan battl cri wow believ someon yelp ed pv freshman year scienc teacher arrest embezzl strip joint own differ teacher everi coupl week first half year final got perman teacher damag done kid connect respect teacher walk door anymor year graduat student graduat class often kid classroom man hate school first start bell rd campu refer pv prison tall iron spike gate secur golf cart patrol campu potenti escape rememb briefli close campu renov girl fall auditorium wall piec ceil fall peopl head condemn year locat suddenli close campu open new campu union hill campu becom north canyon built new campu intent school open build kept fall apart decid shut pv open name new campu spent shit ton fuck load money super high tech theater return let use offici gov event new best thing peopl could run sound light got class frequent rememb make video casey art show school allow air morn video announc use phrase come closet thought phrase might offens week footbal team video pretend gay talk lisp flail limp wrist went offic ask fuck told footbal player need approv anyth rememb friend expel miss much school due chicken pox mother well enough call cours seem invis system ditch class often never show record rememb miss lee dress hard rocker tattoo halloween administr make chang costum influenc rememb friend boyfriend suspend search car drug anonym tip found box cutter trunk use work kept trunk went work straight school rememb test highschool class freshman year yet subject year bullshit pretti sure pvusd inspir movi pump volum film gener area quit softbal team coach school councilor kept send peopl pull class tri talk play took pictur badminton team enough uniform entir team felt like prison high secur mental facil fact mom visit new campu horrifi window use drab grey blue color mental hospit work keep patient calm never chemistri class two histori class consist teacher spent entir year talk shakespear anoth said slave biolog book old friend mother name year earlier friend mother warn biolog teacher mr h ever tell stay class good thing rememb mr toal sp good support english teacher miss lee best photographi video teacher ever alway best halloween costum hang lunch tree boy call rico suav said live box would tell stori horni ladi sneak campu go barrow pizza friend wear cut trojan condom box pin shirt forc spirit assembl chant spirit chant fuck hope die trojan battl cri way blur past make less icki yet sister teacher north canyon year back went visit campu second step main build felt sick stomach liter hear made improv sinc graduat hope want niec nephew forc surviv anoth drone factori,1

"I feel like Top's has been getting angrier and more bitter over time.  I called on Fourth of July just to see if they were open and they guy on the other line told me, ""Yeah and we're a madhouse.  Each minute I spend on the phone with you is another body out the door,"" and hung up on me.

I wanted to call back and tell him, ""You know, the amount of time that it took you to say that, you probably lost two bodies out there door.  You could have just said, 'Yes we are!' and that would have sufficed.  Instead, you had to be snarky so I'm calling you back specifically to waste your time.""

Instead, I'm just going to Yelp about it.

On multiple occasions coming back over the past few months, I feel like I'm tip-toeing through the house when someone's mad at me.  I don't get it.  There's a serious vibe of negativity going on.

"Yikes.  The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because I think their Baja chicken burrito is super tasty &  their Mango Salsa.

Cons:
The place is dirty (dont take my word, read the other reviews)
The employees are always bullshitting until they rudely ask you what you want to order.
The employees never offer suggestions, which may be an English Language barrier.
The front door handle was broken my last time I went in here. Unreal.
The burritos are likley to squirt and get extremely messy on the last few bites....sick.  Dont eat in the car unless you have a blanket in your lap, gross. 

If Im craving a burrito, I will likely just go to the Chipotle across the street and wait in line for 15 mins VS this place....I think the only way Ill come back to this location is strait up steal their salsa and limes from their salsa bar.

"Okay, it's a nice place but I'm not sure I would drive out of my way to go here. I was in town on business staying nearby and thought I'd give them a try. The food was good, but not great. The shredded beef taco was typical and the shredded pork burrito tasted more like beef. The red chili sauce had an okay flavor but the heat level seemed to simply over power everything (and I like hot). The restaurant is very nice inside, very upscale. I guess if you wanted to spend alot for a Mexican dinner in a very nice setting this would be the place. Service was so so, maybe it was because I was a party of one.

During the first visit she gave me this booklet asking for the patients to be quiet and to respect the peaceful place that it is supposed to be but, when I'm in the middle of my treatment I can hear her go on and on and it encourages the patients to go ahead and talk as loud as they want so it's not restful like it should be. It's not an appropriate place for her to do her socializing especially if she's going to try and force her views on the customers that are there to see her husband.

"My boyfriend and I had heard about the great food and romantic ambiance of Coup des Tartes so we decided to check it out.  Overall it was fine but we didn't think it lived up to the hype.

We knew ahead of time that it was BYOB but decided to forgo bringing alcohol because of the corking fees.  No biggie.  We enjoyed the lemonade and minted iced tea they served us.  We weren't hungry enough for appetizers, so we just ordered salads and entrees.  The salads came out quickly and did not disappoint.  I ordered the Springtime Salad ($10) and absolutely loved it.  Mixed greens with organic apples, red onions, dried cranberries, chevre, and candied walnuts with apple cider vinaigrette.  They put just the right amount of dressing on it so it was coated but not drenched.  My boyfriend ordered the Parmigiano ($9) and said it was very good as well.  It was your basic Caesar salad with homemade dressing.  Both salads were surprisingly large and could have satisfied us for dinner if we had ordered appetizers as well. 

Then came the entrees.  Well, sort of.  We sat there until we started to wonder if they were out hunting for our food.  Then we thought maybe we should have ordered an appetizer after all to close the gap a little between the salads and the entrees.  But really, why should we have to pay for something we weren't hungry for just so they can get their pacing right? 

Anyhow, the entrees eventually came.  I ordered the Lambshank ($24) and my boyfriend ordered the Pork ($26).  The lamb fell right off the bone and I didn't even have to use my knife!  It came with a side of Israeli couscous, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  My only complaint about this dish would be the sauce.  It was a harissa spiced vegetable ragout with dried fruits.  For some reason I was expecting something a little thicker.  I felt like the lambshank was sitting in a soup.  Actually, this sauce DID taste like a vegetable stew my mom used to make when I was little that I didn't like.  It was a little bit of a turnoff to me, but not their fault I guess.  (How were they to know?)  I ate it anyway because the meat was cooked so well.  My boyfriend's pork tenderloin was also cooked very well.  It sat atop a bed of risotto and also came with asparagus.  I tried a bite of it, but my dish was so flavorful that it tasted bland in comparison so I can't give it a fair review.  He said it was excellent and finished every last bite on the plate, so I'll take his word for it. 

The service was....ok.  It was fine in the beginning but while they were out hunting for our food between the salads and entrees we were completely neglected and left thirsty.  After we got our entrees it picked up again and was fine until we left.     

The ambiance?  Quaint and pretty, yes.  But quaint does not necessarily equal romantic in my book.  We were seated in a small table jammed into the corner.  The size of the table was fine for two people, but it was way too close to the table next to us which had a party of four seated at it.  Every time someone got up from it to go to the restroom, their backs were right in my face.  We had a nice view of the patio out the window right next to us.  That was until another couple was seated right on the other side of the glass.  My boyfriend felt very uncomfortable for half of our meal because he felt like he couldn't look to his right or else he'd be looking straight at the guy sitting inches away from him.  I was lucky enough to have been seated right next to the wall so I had the view with a little bit of privacy.  The room could have also benefited from some white noise in the background because we could hear everyone's conversations and felt like we couldn't talk at a normal volume without other people hearing.  There was some very soft music playing in the background but it could have been turned up a notch or two.

In a nutshell, I'd give the food four stars but the ambiance and service two and a half stars.  I'd go there again to give something else on the menu another try, but I'd request a table on the patio to get out of that cramped little house.",boyfriend heard great food romant ambianc coup de tart decid check overal fine think live hype knew ahead byob decid forgo bring alcohol cork fee biggi enjoy lemonad mint ice tea serv us hungri enough appet order salad entre salad came quickli disappoint order springtim salad absolut love mix green organ appl red onion dri cranberri chevr candi walnut appl cider vinaigrett put right amount dress coat drench boyfriend order parmigiano said good well basic caesar salad homemad dress salad surprisingli larg could satisfi us dinner order appet well came entre well sort sat start wonder hunt food thought mayb order appet close gap littl salad entre realli pay someth hungri get pace right anyhow entre eventu came order lambshank boyfriend order pork lamb fell right bone even knife came side isra couscou thoroughli enjoy complaint dish would sauc harissa spice veget ragout dri fruit reason expect someth littl thicker felt like lambshank sit soup actual sauc tast like veget stew mom use make littl like littl bit turnoff fault guess know ate anyway meat cook well boyfriend pork tenderloin also cook well sat atop bed risotto also came asparagu tri bite dish flavor tast bland comparison give fair review said excel finish everi last bite plate take word servic ok fine begin hunt food salad entre complet neglect left thirsti got entre pick fine left ambianc quaint pretti ye quaint necessarili equal romant book seat small tabl jam corner size tabl fine two peopl way close tabl next us parti four seat everi someon got go restroom back right face nice view patio window right next us anoth coupl seat right side glass boyfriend felt uncomfort half meal felt like look right els look straight guy sit inch away lucki enough seat right next wall view littl bit privaci room could also benefit white nois background could hear everyon convers felt like talk normal volum without peopl hear soft music play background could turn notch two nutshel give food four star ambianc servic two half star go give someth els menu anoth tri request tabl patio get cramp littl hous,0

"What a fantastic experience!  

If there is a high-end food product that you don't find at whole foods, then you may find yourself to be one of the pickiest eaters known to man.  This place offers everything under the sun.  For the love of God they have almost 30 different types of olives!

My family is new to shopping here and we like to splurge a little bit.  For some reason it's comforting to know that there are 4 different kinds of ribeye and what seems to be almost 100 different types of cheeses.  I guess realizing that makes me think that there won't be anything forgotten at Whole Foods.  Unlike Sam's Club, Whole Foods gives samples that actually taste delicious and almost make you grab for seconds when instead you just grab an actual wrapped portion of the product (darn, had to buy some sometime).

On a 'grocery store' level, this Whole Foods gets 5 stars that's for sure.  The only reason it gets knocked a star is because some Whole Foods locations offer more services to make their guests feel like it is supposed to be much more than your typical grocery store.  This is a location where I think the patrons would be willing to use everything that they had to offer if given the choice.",fantast experi high end food product find whole food may find pickiest eater known man place offer everyth sun love god almost differ type oliv famili new shop like splurg littl bit reason comfort know differ kind ribey seem almost differ type chees guess realiz make think anyth forgotten whole food unlik sam club whole food give sampl actual tast delici almost make grab second instead grab actual wrap portion product darn buy sometim groceri store level whole food get star sure reason get knock star whole food locat offer servic make guest feel like suppos much typic groceri store locat think patron would will everyth offer given choic,0

"I really love Pita Jungle.  My first experience was at the one downtown, and now, I have to get my fix.  I found this location since it is close to my home, and wanted to check it out.

Upon entering, I was pleased with the location.  Well decorated, clean, good lighting, ample seating.  I was greated by the hostess, and sat at the bar.  The place was pretty busy, and I was by myself.  I was greeted in a quick manner by a nice server from behind the bar.  I took a moment to review my menu, and decided to skip a full meal and go for some lentil soup.

Now, here is where things get dicey.  I won't hold it against Pita Jungle, but I have to put this in the review.  First, after being seated, I noticed that it was a little toasty in there.  I think they could have turned up the A/C.  I am sure if I had been drinking, I probably would have broken a slight sweat, as it was warm in here.  

Secondly, after I ordered my lentil soup, it took what seemed like forever to get it.  I did not time it with a stop watch, but it took a long time for just a bowl of soup.  Secondly, when I did get the lentil soup, I didn't care for it.  It looked kinda gross and didn't taste all that great.  And, in case you were wondering, NO, I didn't send it back or complain.  I was to tired and didn't feel like being a sourpuss.

The other problem that I experienced, was the server girl brought out my check WAY before I was ever served my food.  I hate that!  At least bring my bill with my food, not before!

"I always find good used records at Zia.  I know I'll come out with something.  They're pricing is usually pretty high on records/artists/genres that are popular or trendy.  That's pretty standard for anyplace.  The Ghost of Eastside keeps their prices slightly lower with more obscure selection.

However, the flipside is that Zia will overlook gems in their used stock and price them pretty low.  Probably because they don't know much about certain band line-ups, labels or releases in general.  I've found quite a few gems for two or three bucks in the used section.  

Used records are where it's at.  There is no rationale in buying anything new because they'll press those things in such high numbers that they're not rare anymore.  I'll still buy some new things from bands and such.  Not a lot.

Anyhow, I inadvertantly went to this Zia on record store day.  I was eating with my kids at that Chinese place around the corner.

I found a bunch of shit (not all rare but stuff I wanted): The Shit Licker's EP ""Cracked Cop Skulls (total early swede crust/dis), Orchid s/t 7"" on Hand Held Heart, The Automatics ""Golden Hits"" and ""Makin Out"", Chubbies ""Im the King"" 7"" on Sympathy, The Tie That Binds ""Adding Machine"" 7"", Gravy Train ""Hello Doctor"" LP.

"Lovely shop, great cupcake selection, friendly service.  But the real question is...how do the cupcakes taste???  Pretty good.  I tried (4) flavors and they ranged from OK to YUMMMMMM!  Vanilla with chocolate buttercream was ok, the Coconut was good (a bit dry, but decent flavor), the Carrot was very good, and the Mocha was YUMMMMMM!   They were all super sweet though.  My husband and I both had a quarter of each flavor and that was more than enough.  

From a flavor variety and taste perspective, Sprinkles is a 3.5 - 4.  However, I really can't justify spending $14.00 for (4) cupcakes.  They are expensive so they can pay their overhead and lease costs, not because of exotic ingredients or special decorating skills.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure they use good ingredients, but the wrappers are plain, there's no special piping or fondant work, and the flavors are standard. They are just plain good cupcakes...not fantastic, but good.  Certainly not worth $3.50 a cupcake.  I do a ton of baking and I get special order requests from friends and neighbors all the time.

We're both vegetarians and were happy to see a vegetarian section in the menu, but were slightly disappointed with the options. Three of the items included oyster sauce, and the other three were either vegetarian fried rice or red/green curry vegetables. I ordered the green curry vegetables (medium hot), and my friend ordered the red curry vegetables (mild - and she stressed MILD). We waited 20 minutes for our dinner to arrive. I didn't mind my dish - it was waaaaay spicier than medium, but I don't mind a little heat. The sauce was very runny, and the vegetables were soggy and looked they had been sitting in the sauce for quite a while. My friend didn't like her dish at all, mostly because it was quite spicy for being a mild dish. We spent $25 total, and I'm not sure it was worth it.

"They finally just opened a Rita's location in Surprise!! I think it just opened yesterday or today, but it's just as good as the one on Union Hills and 83rd Avenue.  I told my co-workers about it and we basically have been driving by during our lunch break just waiting for it to open over the past few months.
It's hard to explain the texture of the ice. It's thicker than the ice in a frozen margarita, yet it's not crunchy or unrefined like an Icee drink. Sonic has similar ice, but I feel like it's just not as good as Rita's. I guess that's why it's Italian ice. It's in its own category!

There are 3 main types: Gelati's (custard-ice-custard), Blendini's (custard-ice-custard with mix ins like Oreos, M&Ms, etc), and Mistos (ice-custard drink). You can also get just regular custard alone or flavored ice alone. One of their most famous ice flavors is Swedish Fish. There's also a sugar substitute version of their ice and today's sugar free ice flavor was Pineapple. I tried a Red Velvet Cake Gelati today with vanilla custard and it was nothing less than amazing!
The menu is a little confusing since there are so many choices. There are mainly only 2 types of custards though, vanilla and chocolate, that can be mixed with the 12 flavors of ice that consistently change.

While the shop is not as big as a Whole Foods, it does provide the organic and healthy staples, while serving fresh salads, pastries, and different types of chocolates. I didn't get to purchase the local bran of organic ice cream, which seems to be popular. Maybe next time I'm back in Phoenix.

I also liked their little coffee shop in the back room, which is separate from the main shopping area, giving you a bit of quiet to read a book or check your email.

Lastly, all the staff are quirky, yet incredibly friendly. They offered up suggestions for local things to do, and were generally helpful.

"This place really made a terrible situation as easy as possible.  Our cat was hit by a car or beaten, and my husband found her immobile and crying horribly in pain.  We rushed her to the clinic, and the doctor saw her right away.  She told us our options, but was very upfront about the liklihood that our kitty would pass no matter what we did.  She didn't pressure us one way or another, and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision.  My husband asked if they could give her some pain meds while we talked about it, and they gave her some immediately.

Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down, she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.  I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings.  They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed.  They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later.  I really appreciated how they helped us through this difficult time, and I would definitely reccommend them if anyone else is in a similar situation.",place realli made terribl situat easi possibl cat hit car beaten husband found immobil cri horribl pain rush clinic doctor saw right away told us option upfront liklihood kitti would pass matter pressur us way anoth left room could talk privat make decis husband ask could give pain med talk gave immedi made difficult decis put kitti brought cat privat room us could say goodby left us alon gave us much need also let us present room gave final shot time doctor tech compassion respect cri sensit feel treat littl kitti gentli even pass even sent sympathi card hous day later realli appreci help us difficult would definit reccommend anyon els similar situat,0

"I have to say I was slightly surprised when I went to the State Fair this year. Now I wouldn't go as far as saying I was impressed and it's a must for families or friends. My sister and I won free tickets to the fair and reserved seats for The Band Perry Concert off the radio and thought that was a good enough excuse to head that way. We got their around 5:30pm and it was relatively easy to find a somewhat secure parking spot (for $10). 

We went on a Wednesday so I imagine it wasn't as crowded as a weekend tournament, but this day happened to be a day where you could get in free if you bought three canned food items to donate to St. Mary's Food Bank. Good way to save on admission. I think I would be a little irked if I had to pay $10.00 to get in on top of cost for game/ride tickets and food and everything else. The other nice thing about going on a Wednesday is most of the games and rides are half the # of tickets or 4 tickets per game/ride (not all of them but the majority). 

Lines were short and you didn't have to wait much for anything. They sell some pretty strange fair food - I mean I can't even imagine eating fried butter, but I did have a fried Reese's Peanut Butter Cup which was pretty good. 

We went around 7:00 into the Veteran's Memorial Coliseum and it was easy to enter and pretty full once we got inside. We got moved to seats closer than our original section. This is a one time adventure for me and I am glad we went but the fact that it was pretty much free is what made it appealing.",say slightli surpris went state fair year go far say impress must famili friend sister free ticket fair reserv seat band perri concert radio thought good enough excus head way got around pm rel easi find somewhat secur park spot went wednesday imagin crowd weekend tournament day happen day could get free bought three can food donat st mari food bank good way save admiss think would littl irk pay get top cost game ride ticket food everyth els nice go wednesday game ride half ticket ticket per game ride major line short wait much anyth sell pretti strang fair food mean even imagin eat fri butter fri rees peanut butter cup pretti good went around veteran memori coliseum easi enter pretti full got insid got move seat closer origin section adventur glad went fact pretti much free made appeal,0

"Honestly the best part of this place is the unbelievable deal you can get on pet related products. Because they are one of the primary income sources for HALO Animal Rescue, people that have pets, tend to make donations. You can almost always find pet carriers for under $10. They have dog crates for training and you don't have to shell out a fortune for them. They have fish tanks that will allow you to let little Johnny get his feet wet in the world of pet care and the associated responsibilities without breaking the bank. If you are a person that shares your life with animals, you understand the rarity of these kinds of deals!

Yes they have clothes, furniture, tchatchkies, etc., but the real deals are on the pet products.

As a side note, HALO recently leased the MCCAC location at 5231 North 35th Avenue (It was the previous Maricopa County run cat adoption center). So if you are looking for a companion (cat or dog), check them out and support one of the fastest growing no-kill efforts in the US.

"Simply put, this place rocks. CleanFreak has a TON of vacuums, a debugging station, and a fast, very efficient car wash. Best of all, for a mere $17 you can have UNLIMITED car washes. If you have windows, you have probably noticed that it is monsoon season, and monsoons hate clean cars as much as terrorists hate freedom. While I cannot explain why we call monsoons 'haboobs' I can tell you CleanFreak is a great place to wash your car.

CleanFreak has some perks I have never seen at other self car washes. For starters, the employees are outstanding. Somehow they are smiling and seem happy- even in the hot summer heat. They great you and explain how things work, and you get an armor all towel, to clean your interior. As you pull around and queue up for a wash, you are then given your choice of air freshener! Where else does that happen at this price?

I highly recommend checking out the unlimited wash VIP fast pass. There is actually a separate line for people with the fast pass, and how it works is a bar-code sticker is placed on your windshield, and you pull up to the fast pass line, and it scans your pass- and you're in- just like that. This 
saves time, and waiting in line, which is good stuff.

The one thing CleanFreak can do a bit better, is communicating how things are supposed to go. On my second visit, I was getting ready to start through the wash, and I asked an employee for an air freshener. He asked me where my receipt was, and I didn't know what he meant. I asked him what receipt and he told me that if you have a Fastpass, you need to bring the recipt that the machine spits out. I had no idea about that, and explained that to him, and he was cool I think it would save some headaches to either have some more signage, or give people a flyer with an overview of what/how to do things. Otherwise, CleanFreak will take care of you, and for the price of one wash somewhere else, you will have a month of unlimited washes.

"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the absolute best screen display of any Fire model to date. Looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: I compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the Fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the Wonder Woman TV series from the 70's. The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD. For you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50 more pixels per inch than the Fire HD.Wi-Fi Connectivity:The initial Wi-Fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series. After the final operating software update I mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi.My standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of Wi-Fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. In this comparison, I had this HDX version of the Fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the HD Fire, as well as last year's 8.9 HD Fire, Motorola RAZR smartphone, my iPad 2 (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work), and the first-generation 7 Fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a Wi-Fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.My normal website test is to hit the mobile websites of FoxNews, CNN, my personalized Yahoo page, Google, and the Houston Chronicle. The ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the HDX (Houston Chronicle and CNN), and for the other sites I couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. When I went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7 Kindle Fire HD yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the Fire HD but I attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the HDX.Sound / Music Playback:The two speakers are located in the back of the Kindle Fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. My test of this feature was cranking up Van Halen's Panama to maximum volume (I always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and I would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker. The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass. However, I am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as I am in the front: I want to be able to hear whatever I am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like I am). While the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time - I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers. The X-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.Email Setup:Consistent with previous versions of the Fire, email setup was very easy for my main Gmail account, both with the software came with the Fire but my primary use of an existing app called Enhanced Email I purchased here in the Amazon app store. I did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main Google account - and I was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via Google's calendar and contacts. For those of you asking yourself why am I using the Enhanced Email program, the simple answer is like many of you I have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. The lazy person in me appreciates that as I don't like getting out of the lazy chair once I'm settled in!New Tabs and Screen Layout:In addition to the normal tabs Amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. Interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the Fire HD, I purchased the one with special offers and the only ad I have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.Reading Books:Turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same. Amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-Ink Kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as I can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be. If there is an easier way to do it, I can't find it and maybe I should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it). For those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app/a here in the Amazon app store.BluetoothThere is a Bluetooth connection, and I did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the Fire stream music through my car stereo. There were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. Just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.Camera:There is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader. Focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and Amazon will by default store your pictures in the Cloud - which counts against your storage allotment. I'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide Amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.Charger:Unlike previous models of the Fire, this one DOES include a charger! If you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for 20 which always seemed kind of silly for Amazon to do.Mayday button:A new feature with this model, and not included on this year's regular model of the Fire, is the introduction of the Mayday button. Basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent. I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say hi' for purposes of this review.What I Wish it Had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the Fire was ready (why are we waiting). A case is very important in order to protect your investment. Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at 229 for the 16GB of memory model (309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things. Adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while I try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff I do at home with the business apps that are available here in the Amazon App store and other places around the Internet I can also work on Excel and Word-compatible files when I have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD at 139.

"This is the worst Pizza Hut I have ever been to. I was up-charged for something I didn't order. When I asked for it to be corrected it was done wrong again, given the wrong change and had the drive thru door slammed in my face. Asked to speak to the manager and he was extremely hostile. He took my change, receipt and food. After some time I asked for a refund and was told that wasn't possible, too much paperwork. Asked for his supervisors number and was told he was the highest manager, there was no one above him. Right. 

I went to the next Pizza Hut and asked for the regional manager number. I left the food at the restaurant because I was no comfortable eating it after he took it back to correct their mistake. Not sure what could have been done to it.

The young girl at the window did get it wrong twice, but the example the store manager gives is piss poor and is the issue. I hope Pizza Hut sees who they have working for them and speaking on their behalf because according to this store manager, Tim, he's the owner and CEO of the company.

"After visiting family in Scottsdale last weekend, hubby and I spent 3 wonderful days at the Boulders Resort in Carefree. We arrived a little tired and stressed; we left tan, relaxed, and rejuvenated.

The resort sprawls beneath the boulder formations, but you can walk all over on the paths that are well marked. Our room was spacious and clean, with his and hers sinks in the bathroom, shower, tub, king sized bed, and walk-in closet. We were located near the main lodge, and a brisk walk from El Pedregal and the Golden Door Spa. We made great use of the wonderful fitness center and took a few classes as well- yoga, bosu, and water fitness.

We tried both pools during our stay, the spa pool and the main pool. We preferred the tranquility of the spa pool; food and drinks at both locations were exceptional. If you meet Madonna at either pool, ask her to make the ""Madonna Special"" for you. A very refreshing smoothie.

During our stay we ate dinner twice at the Spotted Donkey Cantina at El Pedregal- fabulous margaritas shrimp tacos. Our last night we dined at Rusty's Chop House at the golf club. It was a lovely meal on the terrace with a view of the golf course. 

Every person we ran into was exceptionally friendly and genuine, making the trip even more enjoyable.

"Edit 6/15/17 After three months of use, I still don't love it. It works well, no complaints, but it marks up easily and the sides began flaking off. My original black cover had shown signs of wear due to repeatedly falling asleep with it folded back. I was much more careful with the merlot, and it showed more signs after a shorter period of time. And the flaky thing along the sides looks and feels just cheap. And for 90, I would expect real leather. So I switched back to my original black cover and I'm just letting it age with the device. I guess the plus side is that the merlot made me like the black cover more, but the downside is it cost 90 to do so. Ridiculous.As stated in the title, I love my Oasis. I've had it for about six months and, with the exception of the defective first one I received which was promptly replaced, I haven't had a problem out of it. I had gotten the black cover because black is my default choice, always. However, a couple of months ago I had gotten a screen protector and skin for the Oasis, and I just wasn't feeling the black cover anymore. I had considered the merlot (I think the walnut would feel nicer to the touch, but I despise brown leather) so I gave in after much consideration and ordered it. It didn't arrive with the bundle of things that it was supposedly shipped with, but after a quick call to customer service I had a new tracking number. It finally arrived today. I am disappointed to say that I don't love it. It smells funny, as I done remember my original doing. The color is duller than in the picture. Maybe my expectations had overblown due to the wait and the whole two tracking numbers thing, but I just don't love it.Read more",edit three month still love work well complaint mark easili side began flake origin black cover shown sign wear due repeatedli fall asleep fold back much care merlot show sign shorter period flaki along side look feel cheap would expect real leather switch back origin black cover let age guess plu side merlot made like black cover downsid cost ridicul state titl love oasi six month except defect first receiv promptli replac problem gotten black cover black default choic alway howev coupl month ago gotten screen protector skin oasi feel black cover anymor consid merlot think walnut would feel nicer touch despis brown leather gave much consider order arriv bundl thing supposedli ship quick call custom servic new track number final arriv today disappoint say love smell funni done rememb origin color duller pictur mayb expect overblown due wait whole two track number love,0

"Went back with some veggie friends of mine and wasn't disappointed.  One of them ordered the regular flour quesadilla, and they loved it.  It had veggie stuff on the inside and I tasted a bite which was delicious.  I will probably order this next time I go.  Also, the grilled onion which came on the side was a big hit.  The other friend ordered the mushroom corn quesadilla.  She liked it but didn't love it.  I had the shrimp tacos and, wow, were they good.  

I don't know why, with all the tortas on the menu, but I just seem to prefer the other menu items.  As always, the service was great, and it was very, very busy.  We had to wait to be seated.

"Blurb for iPhone App: Great Enchiladas, Chips and Salsa made fresh, but beans left something to be desired.  Give it a try nonetheless.

I just wrote the last part because I will be on the Yelp app, and notice that I often start my review with something that is not useful at all... which is that everyone sees when searching on their mobile phones.  So I guess you could say I'm optimizing for mobile.  Ok, now on the full review.  

Took off a star for the beans... they just weren't great.  The person with me had a taco salad, and said they didn't get a lot of meat in it... and the rice was good, but not great.  However, this was balanced by the chips and salsa (which I always eat so much of that I'm not hungry by the time the food shows up) which seemed to be made fresh, not too hot, but with plenty of flavor.  The ""hot"" sauce (hot is entirely objective here) was very good, and I used that for my chips as much as the salsa.  Didn't ask if they had anything hotter, as the true chilehead will think it's pretty mild...

I had a chicken enchelada with green sauce and a cheese with red.. and although I usually like the green better, the red here is great.

"I'ld give 6 stars if possible for each and every appetizer we have had. The tomato soup, caesar salad, beignets, and crab dip are all way more delicious than they have any right to be. However, the stand out is clearly the shrimp canapé - one of the best  appetizers I've ever had. Period. 

The other side of the coin is the at-best mediocre entrees. The first night we had a gift certificate and ordered an absurd amount of food and ended up leaving both the burger and meatloaf largely untouched. On subsequent visits the appetizers were consistently amazing and the variety of entrees just didn't live up to the apps. The blackened tacos were bland and tasteless. The meatloaf was swimming in liquid. The burger bun was overly toothsome and the burger bland. 

Long story short - order appetizers (which there are more than enough of) and you will be happy. Also happy hour is great but the wine is overpriced otherwise.

"This place is literally within walking distance from my apartment, yet I have passed by it daily. This morning I was hungry for breakfast and had a lot of things to do so I thought I would try something close. I have noticed the parking lot is usually full, so I thought it must be good. I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.

It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table. The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee. The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it.

"I like perusing Buffalo Exchange, but, whenever I bring some clothes in for store credit, I end up disappointed. They seem to give you very little credit for good items, and they are very picky. So I clean out my closet, take it to Buffalo Exchange, and come back with 3/4ths of the stuff. Discouraged, I set it on my floor and it sits there making my room dirty for months.

I would suggest going in to trade during an off time (not a weekend) when there will be less people trading. They may spend more time looking at your items. They also prefer the items to be in season, so don't clean out your sundresses until May-ish if you don't want to have to bring them back home.",like perus buffalo exchang whenev bring cloth store credit end disappoint seem give littl credit good picki clean closet take buffalo exchang come back th stuff discourag set floor sit make room dirti month would suggest go trade weekend less peopl trade may spend look also prefer season clean sundress may ish want bring back home,1
"I FINALLY tried Fuego Tacos and I really really am a fan! 

So here I was with a Yelp deal and an upcoming national taco day. I do like I do and text some of the InstagramAZ honeys to meet me up at the esplinade for a mini sunset photo walk and an excuse to have some margartias. 

What an amazing combo for a Ladies Night! First off the starter chips and salsa was bomb! BOOM! the salsa has like chipotle flavor, not runny but hearty like steak! hahaha! We also ordered a few Queso appetizers. Dang... Let me say we could have been fine with that and our margaritas. 

Just kidding! Of course we all order food! Tacos galore and delicious! Seasoned to perfection and sided with really good rice and beans.

"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Phoenix. This is where we go to celebrate and to enjoy a night out with amazing food and great service. Noca is an experience. I wouldn't recommend trying to quickly hit up a meal here before trying to catch a movie. I can't imagine trying to rush the experience!

On our most recent visit I immediately ordered my favorite cocktail- the Dirty Bird. It's so perfectly crafted and smooth...plus there are bleu cheese stuffed olives. Sold! I felt a little bad because my fiance wanted to celebrate our new jobby-jobs with prosecco... my bad. Lay off me when there's bleu cheese stuffed olives and vodka involved mister!

First up was the mixed salad. I love how it's not overloaded with cheese and candied fruit. It's the perfect balance of flavors. 

We then had the lobster roll and it was absolutely heavenly. I really hated to share that but I needed to save room for the scallops. The scallops were so perfectly cooked and the plating was gorgeous. The flavors were outstanding- absolutely sublime. Ryan actually asked me if I remembered his name.

Yes, it's a Great steakhouse... but they also have a Great wine selection... and Great bread to start... and Great desserts.... and Great service.

Rich and Richie took exceptional care of us.  They were attentive and fun to talk to... too.

I had the Prime Rib and it was huge and perfectly prepared. I ended up taking the rest home and having it for lunch the next day and it was just as good the following day.  :)

The Bread to start came with 2 different flavored butters.  You could easily fill up on bread before dinner.... so go easy on this as they will keep bringing out refills if you let them.

The Dessert.... we got the Chocolate Lava Cake... and the cake part was good... but the sides that came with the cake... they were Amazing.  The Chantilly Cream they serve on the side of the cake is freshly made and it's a Little Pillow of Heaven.  Rich brought us more when we ate all the cream and still had cake left.  And then they have a little homemade pistachio cookie with vanilla ice cream on the side too... these were great too... So, net, net... I wouldn't order the Chocolate Lava Cake for the cake part.... I'd order it for the things that come WITH the cake.  :)

"Matt's Big Breakfast is a wonderful place in the morning to feel the life of downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten there 5 times in the last year and each meal was worth the 10 to 20 minute wait out side on the sidewalk.  

At 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, July 3, my wife Marie and I ventured downtown and decided to have breakfast out.  Matt's was on our mind.  We waited outside only 5 minutes before getting a table by the window next to the kitchen entry.  Busy place, but the service was great.  Quick with the coffee for Marie and ice tea for me.  Marie ordered an omelet with cheese and mushrooms, while I decided on the special, eggs benedict.  We both had the home fries. 

When everything arrived, the meal was very yummy.  Marie, in her delicate way, snarfed down her omelet with a smile.  My eggs benedict was on a fresh English muffin, topped with ham, poached eggs, and a yummy hollandaise sauce.  Calories be damned!

The whole meal cost $22.53 + 4.00 tip.

"You are seeing a continuing trend here. When it first opened it was a 5 star place but since then the pizza has been inconsistent and going down hill. The last pizza I ordered, the crust was soggy and it had too much yeast. The cheese was also too rubbery and tasteless.

I grew up watching 90210 like many of us ""old folks."" They had the Peach Pit. Do you remember that place. Well Jimmy and Joes is the pizza version of the Peach Pit. Yes, me and my 30's felt age inappropriate when I arrived. And I immediately felt like I was in high school again when I went to grab a tiny ketchup cup to grab some wing sauce and they said it was 60 cents. Another person walked in and they gave him a hard time because he didn't have his coupon on him even though he read the coupon code over the phone. It had that high school vibe..you know the one I'm talking about the...""I owe you 3 dollars and I'll pay you back tomorrow."" vibe.  That vibe is felt when you park there. There is limited parking as it is and whatever parking they have, there are signs that limit you to 20 minutes parking almost implying they don't want you to eat there. I was too afraid to take napkins because I'm sure it had some price or limitation attached just like everything else there.

I've eaten here several times and I've reached this conclusion: eat at the place but don't pick up pizza here. JJ specializes in the one slice and drink. Their short slices are done well and if you don't eat it hot when it comes right out of the oven, it loses it's flavor fast. I've picked up pizza and it's almost like two different pizzas. When I picked it up, the cheese was exrtremely rubbery and the crust was so chewy like steak. This is a great place for a short lunch or a business lunch but I wouldn't order several pies if I was hosting a Superbowl party or had people over.",see continu trend first open star place sinc pizza inconsist go hill last pizza order crust soggi much yeast chees also rubberi tasteless grew watch like mani us old folk peach pit rememb place well jimmi joe pizza version peach pit ye felt age inappropri arriv immedi felt like high school went grab tini ketchup cup grab wing sauc said cent anoth person walk gave hard coupon even though coupon code phone high school vibe know talk owe dollar pay back tomorrow vibe vibe felt park limit park whatev park sign limit minut park almost impli want eat afraid take napkin sure price limit attach like everyth els eaten sever time reach conclus eat place pick pizza jj special slice drink short slice done well eat hot come right oven lose flavor fast pick pizza almost like two differ pizza pick chees exrtrem rubberi crust chewi like steak great place short lunch busi lunch order sever pie host superbowl parti peopl,0

"I don't get it!!
My husband, daughter and I went to eat at Joe's because we saw a menu in the Hotel where we were staying nearby.  The Menu mentioned that the TV show DINERS DRIVE-INS AND DIVES had done a show about the place and indicated the menu items that were highlighted on the show that were supposedly delicious!

I called ahead for directions and was greeted with an attitude when I explained that we were from out of town, staying at a hotel that has their menu and needed directions to get there.  I assumed since the menu was in the hotel room that the employees at Joe's  would know how to direct someone to get there from the hotel.  After I explained several times the cross streets and the name of the hotel where we were staying, explained that we were just north of the 202 freeway etc and was just about to give up, the girl finally was able to give me directions.  Was that an omen of things to come??

The first irritation that we encountered was standing in line and trying to decide what we should order while there was only ONE cashier.   So when we did reach the window to place our order we could practically feel the irritation of the people waiting behind us while we tried to ask a few questions about the menu.  Feeling pressure to hurry up by the impatient look on the cashiers face we ordered a variety of things for the three of us.  The Fontina Burger, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and Fresh Beet Salad.

With the variety of what we ordered you would think at least one of the three of us would taste something we liked, but the only adjective that we could come up with for everything was BLAH.  
I am not exaggerating....we were all hungry and we are not picky eaters, but we just couldn't get a good bite of anything.

Also when I placed our order I asked for side orders of the onions rings and sweet potato fries but the cashier rang up full orders which I didn't realize since my husband paid the bill not knowing it should have been less.  Our bill for the 3 of us was equal to what we would pay at a restaurant with someone serving us!!  I wouldn't mind so much if the food tasted good but......  
TheFONTINA BURGER was cooked very well done (I ordered it medium/well).  It had a very slight smear of pesto (so slight that I couldn't even taste it) with a few small pieces of mushy grilled pepper and the fontina cheese.  The burger was so unremarkable that I can't even remember if there were ""greens"" on it our not.  I would describe this burger as DRY and BLAH.
The ONION RINGS had such a crunchy exterior that it actually hurt our mouths to bite into them.  Besides that, the onion pieces were so thin you could hardly taste the onion.  It was like eating a basket full of crunchy fried breading.
The SWEET POTATO FRIES and the WHITE POTATO FRIES were also just BLAH....how can you mess up fries??  After some serious thought we decided it had to be the type of oil that they were fried in.  It was just tasteless.  Even salt and ketchup couldn't help these fries!  
The BBQ PORK SANDWICH was just okay as was the COLESLAW.  Not really much to say about them.  
The BEET SALAD tasted like dirt.  My daughter and I both love beets but neither of us could take more than one bite of this salad.
The PICKLES that they put on top of everything are just gross.  What they heck is wrong with just a dill pickle?  Why the sweet and sour wierd flavor combo??

There is only one DRINK MACHINE and CONDIMENT BAR and it is OUTSIDE!  So to fill your drink or get your napkins and ketchup you have to go out the door and stand in line then try to get back in the door while juggling everything.  Irritating!

More irriation came in the form of the FLIES swarming our table which made for a very frustrating time of swatting them off of our food between bites. 

We were all hungry but none of us finished our meal because we were just bored and frustrated trying to get a good bite.  We even tried to doctor stuff up by dipping our fries in the bbq sauce and adding ketchup to the burger but we just couldn't fix any of it!

We left feeling ripped off, vowed to never return and decided we deserved to stop for an ice cream someplace on our way back to the hotel to get that IRRITATING, BLAH, SWEET and SOUR, DIRT flavor out of our mouths.

PAY ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS would be my recommdendation to the staff of this place because everything really adds up or takes away from the dining experience.  We were overcharged, irritated by the set up, atmosphere and flies and we were still hungry when we left!  

I am submitting this review because I don't want other people who have never eaten here before to be fooled by the FOOD NETWORK show hype the way we were.

"There is nothing special about this place to speak of, hardly a place I'd seek out to go to again. It's in the heart of Old Town, but doesn't feel Scottsdalian at all.

 I guess it's an OK place to hang out, they have a patio and a cozy interior, (like TT Roadhouse's decor but bigger, and not as cool)  I thought the choice of beer was lacking, the service slow and obnoxious. I fell like I was bothering the bartender by ordering drinks. I really haven't had that experience too often in Phoenix, in Boston every bartender is annoyed to serve you, so I am used to it, but this is Phoenix damn it!  One guy in particular just stood behind the bar with his arms folded, I am not sure of his ""role"" in the whole bar tending process. He didn't even pick up a glass, just stood in defiance of the customers. 

Overall, this place is decent, but I wouldn't choose to go again, I met some friends here and we proceeded to go elsewhere after.It seems as if the Coach House is meant to be a place you meet up have a drink, then bounce to someplace else.

"I was reluctant to try this shop at first.  Some of the reviews that popped up via Google lead me to believe it unpleasant and not well-stocked.  Well, you can fool some of the people some of the time, and today, I was no longer fooled by whatever weird people out there have it in for Double Joy Beads.

Firstly, their Czech seed beads are the cheapest in town.  I'm not even kidding.  I purchased six half tubes and one full for around $10.  The organization thereof leaves something to be desired, but at those prices, browsing should be a joy.  

Their pressed glass and fire polished selections were of average number and price.  

In the Swavorski department, standard bicones, cubes and rounds are not available as singles- only some of the pendant materials, and even then, some come packed two to a bag.  I was a bit vexed by this.  What if someone wants one Baroque for a pendant?

The back sported a nice assortment of findings and stringing materials.  Particularly impressive: a display of natural copper items ready for raiding.  Sales bins occupied the front- some bags currently up for less than a quarter.  

I found the clerk on duty during my visit was more of the hands-off type, but quite personable when I checked out.  

The store itself is a bit hard to find, tucked in a winding strip mall.  It's directly across the street from Arizona Art Supply.  That street is Scottsdale Road, but if you can see the art store from the side where Double Joy abides, you can't be far.",reluct tri shop first review pop via googl lead believ unpleas well stock well fool peopl today longer fool whatev weird peopl doubl joy bead firstli czech seed bead cheapest town even kid purchas six half tube full around organ thereof leav someth desir price brows joy press glass fire polish select averag number price swavorski depart standard bicon cube round avail singl pendant materi even come pack two bag bit vex someon want baroqu pendant back sport nice assort find string materi particularli impress display natur copper readi raid sale bin occupi front bag current less quarter found clerk duti visit hand type quit person check store bit hard find tuck wind strip mall directli across street arizona art suppli street scottsdal road see art store side doubl joy abid far,0

"So I'm apparently oblivious to the fact that anything with the name Joe is owned by the same person.  Luckily for me, I wasn't stupid enough to order bbq pork again.  Joe's Farm Grill is a pretty cool concept and probably the only decent place to eat on this side of the 202 (since Mobsters INC closed, at least).  There are enough review here that clearly he is doing something right.  Suburbanites love to feel like they don't live in a city and, I'm sure, love the idea of a restaurant with picnic tables and trees.  They must because the place was a freaking day care when we went, with snotty brats running all around and climbing on everything.

Anyways, back to the food.  I ordered a BBQ Bacon Burger.  I didn't bother to specify how I wanted it cooked and it was, surprisingly, cooked to a decent medium-well.  I subbed some sweet potato fries with it and they were pretty good.  Little more pepper would have made them great but oh well.  The wife had wanted to sub the veggie fries with hers but they made us order a side of them.  That side was literally 3 pounds of fried veggies and was way too much for any human to consume.  They weren't really my thing but the wife enjoyed.

This place does a lot of things well but they suffer from a lot of the logistical problems that Joe's BBQ does.  The line is better and it keeps people from getting backed up but they seem to run out of menus quickly.  People grab them, carry them in line, and leave them at the window.  As a result, there are no menus left when people walk in.  I refilled the thing twice while I was standing in line.  Also, the condiment/drink counter is outside and all in a row right by the door into the restaurant.  These weird clusters of people trying to get a drink or some sauce develop and creates an obstacle course for people going in and out of the restaurant.  This leads me to my final problem - the indoor pickup window.  While the summer is long and hot (and I'm sure leads to a lot of people usually sitting inside), the day we went had tons of people sitting outside.  When their buzzers went off, they had to go inside to pickup the food.  The single door seemed to be all sorts of hazardous for people going in to get food and people coming out with food.  Finally, and I know this sounds stupid, but the trash can outside has the smallest opening ever.  You cannot actually stick your plastic basket inside the trash can and turn it over to dump your food out.  You have to pick the stuff up out of the basket and throw it away with your hands.  I just finished my meal, cleaned my hands, and now I have to wash them again because I had to handle a greasy, sauce-covered piece of paper to throw it away.

I know this sounds nitpicky but it turned what would normally be a 4-star peaceful lunchtime experience into a logistically stressful nightmare for me.  When you make it hard for me to get in and out with my food, it makes me feel like you don't want me there.  I know they are going to read this and I know they are going to dismiss it just like my gripes about Joe's BBQ but do me a favor, when you build your next restaurant, hire someone with a degree in urban planning to help with the layout instead of just cramming things wherever you think they will fit.",appar oblivi fact anyth name joe own person luckili stupid enough order bbq pork joe farm grill pretti cool concept probabl decent place eat side sinc mobster inc close least enough review clearli someth right suburbanit love feel like live citi sure love idea restaur picnic tabl tree must place freak day care went snotti brat run around climb everyth anyway back food order bbq bacon burger bother specifi want cook surprisingli cook decent medium well sub sweet potato fri pretti good littl pepper would made great oh well wife want sub veggi fri made us order side side liter pound fri veggi way much human consum realli wife enjoy place lot thing well suffer lot logist problem joe bbq line better keep peopl get back seem run menu quickli peopl grab carri line leav window result menu left peopl walk refil twice stand line also condiment drink counter outsid row right door restaur weird cluster peopl tri get drink sauc develop creat obstacl cours peopl go restaur lead final problem indoor pickup window summer long hot sure lead lot peopl usual sit insid day went ton peopl sit outsid buzzer went go insid pickup food singl door seem sort hazard peopl go get food peopl come food final know sound stupid trash outsid smallest open ever cannot actual stick plastic basket insid trash turn dump food pick stuff basket throw away hand finish meal clean hand wash handl greasi sauc cover piec paper throw away know sound nitpicki turn would normal star peac lunchtim experi logist stress nightmar make hard get food make feel like want know go know go dismiss like gripe joe bbq favor build next restaur hire someon degre urban plan help layout instead cram thing wherev think fit,0

Indian Paradise has the distinction of being both great and ethnic. I've only ever eaten there for the lunch buffet, and it is AMAZING!

I keep thinking that I'm gonna be disappointed, eventually... But every single time I have dined here I have come away extremely satisfied and in dire need of a nap. I keep asking myself, how can it be so good? Is it cocaine? Cocaine in the food?! Is it?!

They have different buffet items on different days, but the the mainstay curry chicken remains a favorite of mine. On Friday there is a mushroom dish that I dream about... and on Thursday they have stuffed jalapenos that are a little hot but oh so gooooooood!

"really, I can't believe this place has received such high reviews from people.

my lady and i walked in, and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone ""name please?"", instead of a warm, friendly, french welcome to this rather charming looking place. we didn't have a reservation, which from the looks of how dead empty the place was, didn't seem like a problem. until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to ""fit us in"". it was 6pm, the place had one other couple dining, and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out. it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here, because if you don't, you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff. sorry, i don't plan very much ahead. next time i will, and it won't be here.

anyways, after debating for a minute or two with herself, the hostess decided we could ""squeeze in"" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant. she informed us that we could cork our own wine, for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars. in words only office space could adequately describe,""coup des tartes, what is it exactly that you do?"". 

the food was good, nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate. we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese, which was served warm. now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life, and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert, but i believe salad should be cold and crisp. not soggy and warm. yuck. the cordon bleu was tasty and filling, however, the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken, but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg. i will admit, the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had. my lady got the pork tenderloin, which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for. we were broke for desert, so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts. you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus, other than a $.15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.

this place was rather disappointing. i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't. it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee, but when it comes down to it, it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland. maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred.",realli believ place receiv high review peopl ladi walk greet rather rude pretenti bitch front monoton name pleas instead warm friendli french welcom rather charm look place reserv look dead empti place seem like problem hostess whisk reserv list explain tri fit us pm place coupl dine inform next parti arriv realli look hang would aw love yelper would inform need make reserv go automat piec shit accord staff sorri plan much ahead next anyway debat minut two hostess decid could squeez sat us right top coupl insid restaur inform us could cork wine low low price fuck dollar word offic space could adequ describ coup de tart exactli food good noth spectacular plate got salad appl nut bleu chees serv warm first warm salad life mean sort wordli food expert believ salad cold crisp soggi warm yuck cordon bleu tasti fill howev wobbl tabl extrem annoy cut chicken solv thank staff place jack box gift card leg admit mash potato creamiest best ever ladi got pork tenderloin strang pepperi sweet pair particularli care broke desert unfortun get tri tart would think place promot pois would get fancier menu piec cardstock copi bulk kinko place rather disappoint honestli thought would way comfi welcom insid realli present high class french oh la la wee wee come still locat tini shack hous th street highland mayb locat biltmor give bit cred,1

"this another place that i would give no stars to if possible. 
it's been on the corner of mill and university for as long as i can remember, which is impressive since nothing older than ten years has been able to withstand the rent increases, and even more impressive because i don't know a single person who goes there.

i went in there one time, for drinks and walked past one of the foulest salad bars I've ever seen. for some reason, it's right by the door. instead of walking in to see a hostess stand you walk right into this brown mess of vegetables.

after seeing that first off, i wouldn't dream of ordering food here. the place is also dark and dirty and there's never anyone inside of it.

The merchants send defective products and then negotiate with you to accept the faulty product without refunding 100% amount by extending trappy gestures such as shop coupons.

"I appreciate any airport restaurant that doesn't feel over-crowded or cramped.  We usually have to stop in Phoenix for our layover going to and from California from Texas, so I think this might be our new dinner spot.  It's big, plenty of seating, and clean.

I love the affordable menu options...especially for being in an airport.  My husband and I both got the taco plates (mine steak and his fish) which come with two soft corn tortilla tacos, black beans, and rice.  The tacos were tasty but the rice and beans were flavorless and the rice seemed a bit undercooked.  After I drenched everything with hot sauce I was able to finish my meal.

Although I love the cheap food options (around $6 for a taco or burrito meal), the drinks were super expensive.  Our Bloody Mary was $11!  My mango fresca (non-alcoholic) was about $4.

"Had lunch here with my wife today. It's the second time I've been and her first. After my first visit it rocketed into my top five favourite restaurants of all time. They have some top notch food, and the best thing is that it's such a deliciously welcome change from the bottom-feeder's Mexican crap that you see all over Phoenix. The menu is varied and I think I eventually will want to try everything. Appetizers include fried alligator and frog's legs. The main I had today was their Mardi Gras Pasta, which is linguini with tomato, thin-sliced garlic, andouille sausage, crawfish meat, onion and delicious shrimp topped with a really nice creamy sauce. Absolutely delicious. The wife had mahi-mahi with an even NICER sauce, and dirty rice on the side. Although a tiny bit on the pricy side it's definitely worth coming back to. Large open seating (outdoor seating also available), dimly lit, old-style jazz, a large full-service bar and a very quaint outside waiting area with water feature, giant fans etc. The service was also great and both times I've been, the waiters have been very helpful (the first guy told me that if I got the large serving of alligator, to try it 'half-blackened' - a great tip which allowed me to taste both 'styles' of the appetizer). They also have things I've not heard of before like etoufee and opelousas. If my dad didn't live over seven thousand miles away I'd take him here in an instant - he'd absolutely love the place. You will too.

Oh yeah, they have creme brulee (with fresh fruit) and sweet potato pecan pie, amongst other things, for dessert.

"I went to NOCA about a month after is opened and was wowed. I told all my fellow foodies about my wonderful experience, the innovative menu and all the little extras that made the meal a really special dining experience in Phoenix. 
I went back with friends twice after in the coming months and was pleased each time. 
I just went back this past Saturday though, and would have to say I would no longer suggest it for a special night out. It was as if the magic was gone and that the place was showing its age and loosing its ""specialness"". It was really just ok. The chef's talent shows, but too many other let downs. 
When we arrived for our 8:30 reservation the place was crowded. The host was friendly and told us that our table would be ready soon and it was. We sat down at our table and that's when things started turning out not as well as expected. Seated in a back corner--which I did not mind---I noticed the walls were filthy---scratched and beat up and dirty. That was my view, so of course its all I could focus on. The waiter did not show up for 5 min. to take our drink order, and when he did it took 20 min. to get them to us. He apologized, but at 8:45 on a Saturday night that waiting for a first drink is not fun. 
When then settled down with our menus and picked our choices. It was then we were told that they were out of the veal --which of course 2 of us had chosen by then, and that there was only one Skate dish--which of course the other 2 of us had decided on. They were also out of 3 other items. I felt I was back in the old Eleve (located in this same spot)--the food was great there as well---when they did not run out of many items on the menu. They may be ok when you have a larger menu, but with a small menu to begin with this is a real disappointment. 
Gone were the pop rocks that I thought was so fun as an intermezzo, instead a spoon of something that was not described was set down in front of us. A simple salad--good--was $15---and most starters are at least that much. Good, but not worth the price. Otherwise, entrees were good--not special, but tasty and served with good presentation. The cotton candy is still there--and still an attention getter. And I still love the desert selections---especially the malt that I had with mini doughnuts in with dipping sauces. 
I think I am able to overlook the fact that its really not an attractive room--the energy from the kitchen and the close tables add noise and excitement to the room, but the art and lighting is ugly and now that its starting to look run down as well--there are too many new, beautiful places in the city with equally good food and equally as pricey that are not in strip mall. And they usually still have most menu selections on a Saturday night.",went noca month open wow told fellow foodi wonder experi innov menu littl extra made meal realli special dine experi phoenix went back friend twice come month pleas went back past saturday though would say would longer suggest special night magic gone place show age loos special realli ok chef talent show mani let down arriv reserv place crowd host friendli told us tabl would readi soon sat tabl thing start turn well expect seat back corner mind notic wall filthi scratch beat dirti view cours could focu waiter show min take drink order took min get us apolog saturday night wait first drink fun settl menu pick choic told veal cours us chosen skate dish cours us decid also felt back old elev locat spot food great well run mani menu may ok larger menu small menu begin real disappoint gone pop rock thought fun intermezzo instead spoon someth describ set front us simpl salad good starter least much good worth price otherwis entre good special tasti serv good present cotton candi still still attent getter still love desert select especi malt mini doughnut dip sauc think abl overlook fact realli attract room energi kitchen close tabl add nois excit room art light ugli start look run well mani new beauti place citi equal good food equal pricey strip mall usual still menu select saturday night,0

"Sadly, I'm giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star.  The Manger/operator guy.

Sure, the food here isn't all that bad.  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive, don't seem to be meth addicted, and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.  Looks like the crew changes over quite often, and I know why.

My beef is not with the crew members, oh no.  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.  Nope.  The Manager guy, the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.  That is my problem with this joint.  Elaboration will proceed now.

This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.  Actually, one of the biggest assholes period.  What a douche bag.  Seems like any time I have a coupon, this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order, give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.  Seriously, what is it, 30 cents?  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order, cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.  I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?) I checked the menu, they would have lost 10 cents.  Lady taking my order after P.J.L. (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said ""sorry""  Not her fault.  Never saw her working there after then, was probably tired of that guys shit.  I don't blame you.

Last trip here, they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.  Awesome.  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.  On my trip before the last, I got one for a free corndog.  SCORE!  I cash it in on my last trip, and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.  No sweat, I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.  Go to get my order, ask where the corndog is.  P.J.L. butts in the middle of the order, says ""This is your order, this is what you have"" and was a fucking prick about it.  Me, the customer.  Yanks the receipt out of my hand, gives me an attitude about it.  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that, even at a low rent fast food joint?  Fuck you.  Seriously.  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him, puts his hand in front of the guys face, and says ""ssssshhhhhh"" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.  Who degrades their employees like that?  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.  Instead of listening, he made a complete asshat out of himself.  It was a corndog, what does that cost you anyway, about 12 cents in batter, a stick, and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?  

Dude (cashier guy, tattoo on your arm), tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job.  No one deserves that shit.  I am actually ashamed I didn't say something for you, I truly am.

What would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is.  My rant speaks for itself.  One shithead ruins it for the ones working for him.  For the ones working there, I will pray for you.  You need it.  P.J.L., get out of there and become a pimp in Tijuana, they need midget controlling assholes over there.

"So I had this important event to attend in California and I've already spent a lot of money preparing for my trip. Earlier in the month I had received a coupon for $40 off any service at Epic salon. Wow, that is a lot of savings and I could sure use to save some money. Epic uses  Goldwell products which is my product of choice. I just needed a tint touch-up (about 1"") so I went to this salon... I had already had an awesome experience at another salon in town, but I couldn't pass up the savings by using the $40 coupon)  I was second-guessing the idea of trying a new salon since I had already found one I absolutly loved. .Again though, the coupon lured me in. Anyway, I walked away with the worst experience ever. Not only was my color wrong ( I am a golden blonde and she colored my 1' outgrowth to a 3"" ash) when I went back in to explain what was so wrong with it (5min later), the front desk lady was rude and cut me off as I was speaking to her. Not the best way to handle a pissed of lady expecially about her hair! I gave them a chance to fix it and the only thing they did was put a gold glaze on my hair, which did not help at all.  The style sucked too. I just left. I did not have time to see if they could fix it again. I will not be going back to this place for any services. Noy only because the hair experience was bad, but because the front desk gal made a bad impession of the place even worse with her nastiness. UGH!

The food is just as spectacular as it was the first time we went! 

The service however was just not good. Our waiter seemed dazed and confused the whole time we were there. And slllllow.

"As a background, I am a retired Information Systems professional and I am writing my first impressions of the Fire HD 8 from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user. I have all the current e-readers and Fire devices from Amazon including the basic Kindle, the Paperwhite (2013,2014,2015 models), the Fire HD6, Fire HD7, Fire HDX7 and Fire HDX8.9 (3rd and 4th generation). Here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new Fire HD8.Amazon removed the Fire HD7, the Fire HDX7 and the Fire HDX8.9 and replaced them with the Fire HD (7 screen), Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10.HARDWARE:WHAT COMES IN THE BOX: The HD8 Fire, a short USB cord and a power adapter. Finally, Amazon ships a power adapter with their Fires so you can charge and use the device right out of the box. (Picture attached)SIZE: The HD8 is longer than the older HD7 but the same width as the discontinued HD7. It is also thinner. (8.4x5.0x0.3 versus 7.5x5.0x0.4). I have large hands and can hold it with one hand, but even with my hands, I really need to use both hands. Because it is longer, it seem top heavy to me. The back is also slick and slippery to hold. Mine has a habit of sliding off the table.Display: The resolution of the screen is 1280 x 800 same as the HD 7 but the pixel density is lower due to the longer screen length. In practical use, though, you can't tell the difference. The display is nice and bright but barely readable in bright sunlight. One nice touch is that now, you can choose your own wallpaper!

"When I saw this place pop up along the everyday path home, I had such great hopes.  I was counting the days until I was able to hit this place for a nice weekday lunch.

With an such and ostentatious name as ""The Scottsdale Salad Company"", I was oh so stoked about a genuine alternative...  I envisioned crazy vegan vigilance, staunch environmental activism and a ridiculous gargantuan AYCE salad buffet teaming with fresh usuals and exotic fare.  I would stuff myself into lunch coma with all manner of crazy nosh all while maintaining some personal self-image of ""health"" under the guise of a ""salad bar"".  Glorious.

Alas, I was so, so disappointed.

It's basically a shell of a quick-serve Chinese restaurant very slightly skinned to be a basic eatery.  The place was virtually empty at high-noon on a Tuesday.  I ordered the large Parisian Salad and a soda.  I was expecting a freshly tossed salad piled high on a plate with a flourish deserving of the name ""The Scottsdale Salad Co.""!!  Rather, I got a pre-packed romaine lettuce and cabbage bomb in a plastic clamshell.  Oh, my soda was a nice styrofoam cup I filled on the fountain machine.  All for about $10.  Food cost couldn't have been more than $2 even if purchased from Costco next door.  I certainly wasn't paying for the ambiance.  Lame.

A couple people there got a wrap, which appeared to be emaciated and a general poor excuse for a wrap which I'd like to pay money for at a restaurant.  I could make the same lame roll at home for about $1.

As is, this place is simply another ticking timebomb of another indy resturant failure.

"Back from holiday and had some amazing soups that made me reflect back on my experience here.  I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and I'm sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  
When paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.  I would like to offer a suggestion that may help her, so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front, and that is to consider a different style of service.  The place is so small that she could have customers order from the chalkboard, if readable, and then deliver the orders.

"I think its about time I wrote a formal review for this establishment, considering I have recently bestowed it as ""My Favorite Restaurant"" - that's a big title to carry. 

I often judge Mexican restaurants based solely on their chips and salsa and Gallo Blanco passes that test.  They have a delicious green tomatillo and smoky chipotle - as well as the typical hot sauce and fresh pico.  Their chunky guac is delish and summery, as they put orange slices in it. 

Although the chiccharon gets a lot of buzz (I think it taste like Cheez-Its), their best appetizer is the Elote - grilled corn-on-the-cob with cheese on it. It literally melts in your mouth! Oh, and it doesn't get stuck in your teeth like most corn-on-the-cobs tend to. 

The orange cake is AMAZING and reminds me of my beloved red velvet - except, you know, orange.

Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friend's birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron. It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out. The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom. At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave. My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out. As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident.

 I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of.

"This place is great!   I've eaten here twice now and both times the food has been wonderful.  I've driven by this place for years and it always looked closed to me.   The windows are very dark.   My husband's barber told him his customers (the barber's) drive all the way from Scottsdale to eat here.    We decided to try it out after hearing this and reading good reviews about it on Yelp.   The first time we went for dinner.  I had the Osso Bucco and my husband had Seafood Paella.   Both were great.  I've had  Osso Bucco in high end restaurants that couldn't compare to this.   The second time we ate here for lunch.   Husband had the Philly Cheesesteak with Peppers, Onions, and Mushrooms.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs.   I had some of his sandwich and we both agreed it was the best Cheesteak we've ever had.  The sandwiches are loaded with fillings and are not salty.   Spaghetti and Meatballs were good but I like Babbo's and Humble Pie's better.    I would have given it five stars but the atmosphere is not the best.   Our first waiter even told us they do have the reputation for being a hole in the wall.   The service is very casual with no sense of urgency.  On our second visit for lunch our waitress told us she had been there over five years and they have quite a few regulars.    Both times we have visited the restaurant was almost full.

To get to Food Truck Fridays in Downtown Phoenix!

I know that all you business Yelpers go out for lunch on Friday's, it's basically a rule if you sit in an office, a cubicle, or behind a desk somewhere from Monday through Friday; don't believe me, check the company hand book you were given on your first day of work. Somewhere between how to comb your hair, what you shouldn't wear, and please don't come in smelling like Nair, you'll find it. While Yelping about your Friday lunch is purely optional, I certainly hope you do ;-)

During your weekly 1 hour exodus into the space beyond the cubicles and plaster walls, ending up in the open air of Food Truck Friday will kick off your weekend right. It's not just for Burger King people, it's time to get it your way! 

Pick your favorite food from, Gourmet Hot dogs with Short Leash, or Mexican with Luncha Libre, Smoothies and Salads with Mojo Bowl, to Pies with Mama Toledos, and Creme Brulee with Torched Goodness. Bring your friends and your favorite gal; they can choose their own favorite too. Don't worry about bringing cash, everyone here will swipe your plastic just as easy.

This is your lunch hour, kick back and forget about work while you're here, if only for 45 minutes. Listen to the DJ's spinning popular music through their thumping sound system while you dine on your fine food. Chill out in the seating area which is cordoned off with misters, fans, and swamp coolers; bringing down the temp from a roasting 108 to a palatable upper 90's. 

This is your Downtown business Yelpers, it's time to kick off those business casuals, and make Friday lunch your own!",chicken cross road get food truck friday downtown phoenix know busi yelper go lunch friday basic rule sit offic cubicl behind desk somewher monday friday believ check compani hand book given first day work somewher comb hair wear pleas come smell like nair find yelp friday lunch pure option certainli hope weekli hour exodu space beyond cubicl plaster wall end open air food truck friday kick weekend right burger king peopl get way pick favorit food gourmet hot dog short leash mexican luncha libr smoothi salad mojo bowl pie mama toledo creme brule torch good bring friend favorit gal choos favorit worri bring cash everyon swipe plastic easi lunch hour kick back forget work minut listen dj spin popular music thump sound system dine fine food chill seat area cordon mister fan swamp cooler bring temp roast palat upper downtown busi yelper kick busi casual make friday lunch,0

Instead of lobster we were given mussels (which were gross), instead of assorted tempura and shrimp tempura we only got assorted tempura with 2... that's right only 2 shrimp in the whole mix.  The yakisoba was the only part of the order they got right and it was not that great, pretty bland.

My good buddy just wanted an IPA and all they had was the normal domestic beers and a few other quality ones.  Then, the Spanish ham was not very good and once you take into account the price it was terrible.  We had a sausage plate where the sausage was dry.  The Calamari was extremely oily.

"I bought 2 of these for christmas presents and I have to say they aren't very kid friendly. Every kindle I've had in the past has been pretty easy to use, this one has a lot of options that I think could be elsewhere to make it easier for a child to navigate. They have an easier time using the other devices (kindle fire, or kindle app on their other tablets) which is unfortunate because I wanted them to be able to have something strictly for reading. Also for a kids bundle its very disappointing that most children's books don't work with this device. No where on the kids bundle page does it state this is an 8th generation kindle. Now, I have a few kindles and have bought new ones as they come out, but I haven't followed close enough to know this is an 8th generation without that information available on the page. I planned on buying these devices so bought a bunch of books listed as available for e-readers 5th generation. I assumed since it was the latest one listed, and my new devices didn't have anything listed, it was the latest. I just found out today that its an 8th generation and a lot of books aren't available on this device, with hopes that will change in the future. So now I have a lot of money spent on books they have to read on their old devices (the devices with games and access to the internet and videos). I spent extra money on 2 new devices so they had something to use daily without that access, all to find out their age appropriate books can't be read on their new devices. I think this information should be available to parents who are looking for a device they can sit their kids down with and not have to worry about them not focusing on something so important to them.

Our group of friends hadn't seen each other for a while.   Busy catching up, we didn't open our menus for quite a while.  I was impressed that our waitress (her name might be Mel) kept coming back in the nicest way to check on us, but didn't interrupt our conversation.   She kept letting us know that she was ready when we were.  

When we were finally ready to order, she asked:  ""Separate checks?""   Terrific.  That was exactly what we needed.

I hadn't expected to like the food, because I had heard and read that it was all the  high-calorie ""comfort"" variety.   It was a nice surprise that I was able to get low-calorie substitutions for the sides that went with my entree.

"Someone already commented on the large Cow mural, I was not going to because it might just be me, but I have heard a few comments about it now. Yea, really odd choice, and kind of uncomfortable to be eating a burger and having Elsa the Cow, with very sad eyes, staring at you while your biting into one of her relatives. Other then that, I feel that they did a good job on the decor. Really nice in fact. 
Now I ordered the Zin Burger, and it was very good. I mean as I was eating it, it was as good as any burger that I have had. As good as Gallo Blanco, and Hula's. Very juicy, flavorful, I liked the bun. It was a 5 star until I stopped eating it. Yep, then it lost a star. How? After I was done, my mouth turned into the Salton Sea. Holy crap, easy on the sodium chef!!! Way too much salt. Now I know what salt does, but overkill. I actually tasted salt for the next hour.  You had me with everything else, just don' t want to feel that I just sucked on a pretzel. 

Only other complaint is the pricing. Like everyone else on here, I think the pricing is all wrong. Especially if your going solo. I mean as a single diner I have to order a basket of fries? I thought Delux was stupid for doing so, why make the same bad move. I also saw most people sharing a burger. If thats not a sign, when customers have to get creative on how to eat at your place without breaking the bank, take a good hard look at how you might make your customers more happy.

"It is with great regret that I give House of Tricks three stars.

I've been here twice.  The first time, friends invited me and the wifey here for dinner.  Seeing the patio, I thought, ""oh, this is really cute.""  Once seated inside, I thought, ""oh, this is really cute.""  Seeing the prices on the dinner menu, I thought, ""oh, this better be really good.""  Long story short, it was okay.  My friend, who had only been here for lunch, apologized for the unexpectedly high prices.  I didn't care too much, I guess.  It was edible.  I'd probably come back for lunch.

Which I did, with co-workers in tow.  The prices at noon were certainly more agreeable and we all looked forward to a pleasant meal.  Suddenly, this gem of an exchange occurred between our waiter and my boss, Debbi:

Debbi:  How large is the quiche?  I weigh 230 pounds, so I'm a big girl.

We giggled.  Debbi loves to joke.

This last time, I had a grilled-chicken sandwich with pomegranate vinaigrette, goat cheese, sliced pears, dried cherries, and field greens on ciabatta.

"I will be moving to Phoenix in the Winter and I thought I'd scout out some LFS while I was visiting, which led me to Reef Culture. At first I was positive seeing some nice looking displays and LED use, however this soon changed.

 On closer inspection, lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae, and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home. The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down. When I did manage to get their attention, I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby (I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon+ to tiny DIY LED picos). 

After this rude and demeaning experience, I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish. I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps, amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me. There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down, snapped his fingers at me, and told me to ""stop harassing the fish."" Keep in mind, I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was, much less reach to ""harass"" any fish. After this rude treatment I promptly left. This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable, not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks (one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too).

"I stayed at San Carlos May 19th - 20th. It was merely ""okay"".

I liked: 
Historic old school hollywood feel. It was chic. I dug it. 
The place had character and I particularly liked the outside of the rooms more than the in. We were in walking distance to the places we wanted to go. 

How about no on these items:
Surprise! No hotel parking. You can pay the Valet 20 bucks or pay 15 over at chase's parking lot. 
Surprise! They hold an extra $25 on your card in case of room damage. 
Ghost lounge? It was Saturday night and the dance floor was empty. It wasn't the plan to go there but it was kind of depressing to see that....
Ghosty goodness? Nope. There was a somewhat weird vibe about the place but nothing really standing out. My house has had more ghosty vibes and action that I received here. 

It has the potential to be pretty awesome but the surprise extra money you end up spending seems like it makes up the difference of what you save.

"Love it.

Last night I dropped into Romanelli's for the first time after driving past a time or two.  Glad I did.

It's a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats, cheeses and breads.  They also sell all things culinary Italia.  

When I stopped in it was 30-40 minutes to close.  I went directly to the deli counter for a sub and was met with a challenge as I decided which to try.  I opted for George's Special (ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella, pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers).  Given the close proximity to closing time I was expecting a sub on older bread that had been sitting around all day but it was still soft and very fresh.  The sub is easily the best I've had.  Amazing.

I also purchased a cannoli.  I'm picky about these things.  Too many places fill 'em and stock 'em and the filling makes the shell soggy.  Romanelli's fills them upon order just like the Italian bakery near a friends house in Newark, NJ (until last night the best cannoli I've had).  The cannoli was top notch.  Simply the best.

Right here in Phoenix, on one night, I had one of the best meals ever.  I cannot wait to return.

"I've been here a few times. I love that it's vegetarian friendly! I think I've ordered every vegetarian option they have, the most recent being  the Veggie Cole Turkey. I think it might be my favorite. The mock turkey they use is divine and the coleslaw & Russian dressing are so tasty! 

The staff is always super friendly and the service is always quick. Prices are a little higher than what you'd pay at any other chain sub shop, but that's not really a con to the place. The quality of the ingredients make it worth the price. And you get a lot for what you pay for. A small is more than filling! 

A few things I wish they would change is the fact that they use so much paper to wrap their sandwiches. It's quite wasteful and I feel like my small sandwich wrap paper takes up the entire table. Also, I really wish they would have a Veggie Bobby on the menu!

"I am a prime member. This was my first purchase of Echo and I gave it to my mom who did not want it or think she needed it, haha I purchased Echo dot for 2 reasons, 1) I had wanted the original echo but thought the near 200 price tag was too steep so this price was perfect and 2) I wanted to get something for my mom that would open her mind to the power of technology and the need for change because ultimately I want her to have amazon fire tv because her monthly cable bill is insanely high but she has always been resistant to change. She had no wifi in her bedroom but I resolved that when I purchased TP Link AV500 Wi Fi Range Extender, Powerline Edition which did what no other wifi extender I purchased in past could do, gave my mom's room a secure wifi connection apparently using already existing phone lines. All I know is that she now has wifi in her room. So I got Echo as a way to test her wifi connection with something cool. I easily connected Echo to TP-Link and it worked. We asked Alexa a few basic questions, We laughed a little but then I had to leave. When I returned the next day, I walked in and there was music playing (oldies but goodies) and I walked into my moms room and she was singing but was emotional. I asked her if everything was ok. She was in awe. She was happy. She was emotional because Alexa helped mom find songs at a blink of an eye that mom had not heard since her childhood and she demonstrated it to me. The speed that Alexa found the song and played it was mind-boggling. Mom was also planning a dinner in August and needed to know what day of week it was. She would normally need to leave her room and go to her main calender in the kitchen and find the date.

"Okay, I have been to DryBar on multiple occassions and have been pleased once, maybe twice, but it wasn't horrible.  Unfortunately, the day of my wedding was horrible.  My fault that I didn't go in for a practice run, BUT I was assured by their ANSWERING SERVICE that I would get ""one of their best,"" because that's who they send out.  The lady that came to our hotel room to do our (my mom and me) hair was rude and not talented.  She barely spoke and when she did it was defensive and not from a place of yes.  When a bridesmaid (who went to DryBar to get her hair done and wasn't satisfied) agreed with me that my hair style should be fixed, the stylist looked at her phone and said,""well, what time is it?"" as she argued with us that she couldn't do anything else with my hair because it's fine.  We were like ""we don't care what time it is, it's my wedding, and I will pay you whatever it takes to get my hair looking the way I want it.""  My mom hated her hair, took pictures to send to DryBar and then fixed it herself.  The problem with getting a quick solution is that they have an answering service which makes problem solving an issue, especially when you have limited time and makes scheduling a large group complicated.

"I lived in AZ for a year whilst at JP Morgan. One of the few great experiences i had out there (back in LA now) was, going to their Good (yes, capital G) food places, they were really really, really Good...certainly on par with eateries I've experienced in London, NYC, Paris, et cetera.
I finally found a neighborhood that had (gulp) personality: the Roosevelt district. I was so happy and comfy in my hundred-year-old guest house with hard wood floors, huge pre-air conditioning windows, a sizable green backyard, and an unobstructed view of the teenytiny Phoenix skyline. And just down the street from my extraordinary little residence was the absolutely amazing, wonderful and perfect Tammie Coe (the person AND the bakery) who had just opened their venerable doors.
I was there every morning for their exquisite breads, cheeses, sweet things, perfect euro-standard coffee, lovely attendants....I miss it so much.
It reminded me of Patisserie Valerie in London, or any good bakery in Paris...with a cool, fun and welcome American twist.

I shall always go back to Tammie when ever I find myself in dreary Walmart-ized Phoenix. Tammie, you are an artist. My only hope is that you will consider opening a location in Los Angeles.

"I know that all Melting Pot locations gets mixed reviews... usually the price turns people off.  It is a little pricey, but it's all about the experience.  Also, since it's a time-consuming experience, one tends to be there about twice as long as at a regular restaurant.  So I don't really mind the price for a once in a while kind of thing.  My hubbie and I have been 8-10 times... twice at the Scottsdale location.

The husband and I always order the ""Big Night Out,"" generally the ""Lobster Indulgence.""  (We figure if we're going to spend a pretty penny, we might as well really make it worthwhile.)  Maybe since we always do the lobster thing, the price doesn't bother me as much.

Don't remember the specific themes the times we went to Scottsdale, but the ""Big Night Out"" meals go like this:  Cheese Fondue (you can choose the special or any from the regular menu) with assorted dippers, Salad Course (again, the special or off the menu), Main Course (if you get the ""Lobster Indulgence,"" it includes twin lobster tails, usually a couple kinds of beef (e.g., filet and sirloin), shrimp, chicken, salmon, and/or pork, often a stuffed pasta, and lost of vegetables) with assorted sauces, and the best part... Chocolate Fondue with fresh fruit, brownies, marshmallows, Rice Krispies Treats, etc.  Yummy!

I must say that your experience also really depends on your server.  If you get a bogus one, you might not have a great time.  We've had good experiences for the most part, some absolutely awesome experiences.

$49.00 service call

$199.00 no fuss price to replace the sensor (#3 on their Straightforward Pricing)

They replaced the small recessed photo sensor with one that extrudes from the side of the house. Clearly it is not the same part. WTH?!

I phoned Mr Sparky to log my complaint - they were very nice. As of now, the owner of the franchise will be calling me to discuss my options. I'll post an update on the results.

"First off, I would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just 139.99. I tried finding a tablet for under 100 that would just work properly, and to let you know, it's impossible. Secondly, I want to tell you how I decided to buy this tablet.I first bought the 9 inch Dragon touch tablet for 78 but to be blunt it sucked. It was so slow that the web browser would always freeze, even if I did a simple Google search. I did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after 2 days of using it then I decided to give the kindle fire HD a chance.Exterior: The exterior is well built. No loose pieces, and the plastic is very firm. My previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard. Of course the iPad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body, but it also starts at 329. There are 2 ports: a micro usb and a headphone jack to plug in your headphones. The nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find. Although, amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable/ wall charger along with your kindle. The previous kindle did not include them and they are worth 20. The buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch. I would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons.Only down side is there is no port for an SD card so you can store more memory. It would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage, go buy a computer.Display: One word, amazing. Maybe I am pushing it, but the screen is so clear. I own an iPhone 5 and my eyes prefer my kindle. I love reading on this machine and for the price, amazon did a good job with this one.Read more",first would like say great deal tri find would work properli let know imposs secondli want tell decid buy first bought inch dragon touch blunt suck slow web browser would alway freez even simpl googl search want take chanc anymor return day use decid give kindl fire hd chanc exterior exterior well built loos piec plastic firm previou cheap plastic felt go snap held hard cours ipad mini glass screen aluminum bodi also start port micro usb headphon jack plug headphon nice micro usb univers find plug cheap easi find although includ nice cheapli made cabl wall charger along kindl previou kindl includ worth button volum power nice touch would surpris new gener tablet includ style button side port sd card store memori would nice featur realli need storag go buy comput display word amaz mayb push screen clear iphon eye prefer kindl love read machin price good job,0

"Hate is such a strong word.. I try not to use when I its not really called for. When I set out to Yelp the Safeway across the street from me and the Mr.'s place I thought of using that word to describe how much I don't like this Safeway.  Of course it's warranted, they pissed me off!

Okay you know how they always do BOGOF on milk.. well me and the Mr don't drink that much milk so the cashier usually just gives me half off the 1 gallon. Well this time she forgot to and I didn't notice until I got home.. so seeing that I used to shop here once a week I figured Id just bring my receipt back the following week. Well the following week I went in and showed the receipt and the dumb bitch behind the counter was like, 'what am I supposed to do about it?'.. I explained to her what usually happens as the cashier gives it to me for half off.. she then proceeded to ask me which cashier was doing that, 'it's not our policy.'
After going back and forth for a few minutes I finally just told her to give me my 2 bucks.. she told me if I would have brought them the receipt back the same day they would have done something about it. Are you f-ing kidding me? Whats the difference besides my being inconvenienced having to drive back there. So I finally asked her if she was willing to lose a potential lifetime customer over 2 bucks? She responded, 'there's nothing I can do for you.' I then told her that her customer service skills suck and that I will NEVER return to the store. 

I guess never say never since I went into my very much disliked Safeway the other day. Believe it or not they make a pretty damn good sandwich and I despise Subway. So the 2 stars are for the yummy sandwich and the super cute guy who made it!

"The food was decent, however I am writing about their underhanded business practices.
I ordered a travelzoo voucher for $69 that included 2 3 course meals. It said ""Regularly $140"". What we ordered, if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about $100. However, we were charged tax on the full $140. 

Second, even though on the voucher it says ""PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK."" (which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount) and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity, 18% gratuity (18% of $140, even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most) was automatically added to our check.

Third, even if you had ordered the most expensive options, the highest possible amount it could be worth is $120, not $140. It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a $140 value, but that is what they add tax and tip to.

Fourth, after we told our waiter we were using a voucher, he seemed less interested in the service level of our table, which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18% (of $140) tip.

The food is excellent, the service is so poor I am disappointed. I advise anyone who comes here to sit at the sushi bar and deal with the Chefs, they are great. I talked to the owner and she was just as bad as the servers.

"Last night on my way home from work I figured I would pick up some dinner for me and my wife who is taking care of our newborn all day and has little time to cook for us. I ordered chicken limone the menu says serves two to three and we don't eat a lot so I figured it would fill us up. The price was 18.99 but I figured in a family style Italian place and we should have plenty of food. 

I was handed my bag and I was sure it was the wrong order because it was so light so I checked it in the car and was shocked. 

I see three small pieces of chicken in a big container with a small piece of bread and that's it! 

So I figured they just forgot the pasta and went back in and asked the hostess and she said yes it comes with it then said no after thinking about it. 

So how can they justify that price? It was so small there was no way it would feed 2 people so I had to cook pasta at home and then reheat our chicken in the microwave.

I worked in the service industry for years and this place is a joke!

"Just fantastic. I first went to Cornish Pasty in 05' a few months after they opened and fell in love immediately. Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative. 

If you are not familiar, a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food.  A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked. Kind of a hand-held meat pie. Cornish Pasty Co. has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component. Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky. Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality. 

Beyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science, Cornish Pasty Co. has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors. It's no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties. What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties. Perhaps my favorite pasty, from the cuisine most elusive to the British, is the Carne Avadado. This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las Cruses/El Paso foodie. If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean. 

I have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints. It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads. Now that I have had the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup, it is hart to save room for my old favorites. 

Although the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there. The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff, but everyone is friendly and service is typically good.

If I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one.  No clue why, but everyone I've talk to seems to agree, the Tempe store has the edge on quality.  

After you add a respectable selection of beers the only reason you won't be here every night is your waist line.",fantast first went cornish pasti month open fell love immedi although thing chang year usual improv never neg familiar pasti tradit british coal miner food hearti fill wrap pie crust bake kind hand held meat pie cornish pasti co taken simpl tradit dish meticul perfect compon crust simultan hearti flaki although noth delic season never balanc ingredi alway qualiti beyond master finer detail pasti scienc cornish pasti co also branch wild exot flavor shocker british know indian food show tika masala lamb vindaloo pasti shock refin greek italian inspir pasti perhap favorit pasti cuisin elus british carn avadado mexican inspir pasti satisfi even snobbi la cruse el paso foodi ever talk mexican food know mean eaten nearli everi menu disappoint took age get past pasti start order soup salad spinach mushroom walnut soup hart save room old favorit although mine shaft inspir interior dark cramp never felt uncomfort sound system usual bump classic rock employe pierc tattoo well beyond typic wait staff everyon friendli servic typic good list neg think food consist littl better univers locat dobson clue everyon talk seem agre temp store edg qualiti add respect select beer reason everi night waist line,0

Laura got the Mimosa with Champagne and the Margarita / Tequila.  I really enjoyed both of her's the margarita was a strawberry one which is my fav.  The Mimosa was very refreshing and I could imagine that being a great hangover remedy at about 11am on a Saturday =) just sayin.

"ZERO stars!
I traveled from STL to SFO a few weeks ago (with a layover in PHX). I have a couple complaints;
One, I was checking 2 pieces of luggage in STL. One ended up being 14lbs. over weight (it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad). I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $35 initially for the cooler to ship (including the $25 for my first bag- so $150 total)! This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge! I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $25 like other airlines I've had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)! On top of that I paid $250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were $400 total... $100 more than my round trip ticket to fly. I couldn't believe that!
On another note, the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I've ever dealt with anywhere! She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn't allow her to fly. She raised he voice at me and called me ""a very inhumane person"" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry. I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem, including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO. This woman name-calling was totally inappropriate... people in line beside me were astonished. Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already, and she was sick of fighting with me over it, she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn't let me on the flight (and of course the gate person did).
Between the dog crate episode and the bags, I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees. I'm very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past. It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation.

"NOCA...  wow.

Have you seen the outer limits show where the chef owns a device that when placed in a small room with a single person drives the person completely insane with fear but creates a liquid extract that adds complete and utter bliss to food.

NOCA must have gotten their hands on this relic.  Honestly.  This has probably been the best dining experience of my life.   Everything was delicious on its own, all together, or when combining just a few of the items on the plate.  

Walked in and our server seated us.  They brought us an amuse-bouche that had a small amount of blue cheese, chorizo, and chives.  Was delicious.  Then bread was served. After that, our Bacon and Egg was served.  This was phenomenal.  A crispy perfectly poached egg with oh so tender pork belly....mmmm

My fiance ordered the butternut squash cannelloni and I ordered the duck.  Both were amazing.  The duck was so moist and tender but not greasy at all.  We then were served cotton candy as we waiting on our 2 desserts to arrive.  We had the donuts and the de-constructed cheesecake.  I had an espresso and my fiance had the vanilla malted milk shake.

I know its a lot of food but we wanted to try a good variety and it cost about $27. Not to shabby! the spinach and garlic was really fresh and flavorful. The bread was decent, almost like a dense curried bread. The pork dumplings were similar to soup dumplings, one of my most favorite dumplings ever. The pork pie was almost like a pork patty covered in dumpling dough and pan-fried. It was crunchy, moist, juicy and delicious all at the same time. We were getting full so we ended up only eating half of the green onion pancakes which were well prepared. We will definitely be making another trip back here soon.

"Food? Awesome. Service? Sufficient. Layout? Not the best.

We stopped into Chompie's this past Friday morning on our way out of town for the long weekend. My husband and I have this obsession with breakfast bagels - in particular, breakfast bagels from one amazing joint that makes the absolute best breakfast bagel EVER in our college's hometown. We are always searching for a place as good as Bodo's...well, even 3/4 as good as Bodo's would do...and we never find it. Bodo's is about the most efficient bagel store on Earth (literally the line of 40-50 people is serviced in 10 minutes) and cheap, too!

So, we decided to give Chompie's a whirl. I don't love the location - like everything else in Arizona, it is tucked into a strip mall. However, there was enough parking and we found it just fine. When you walk in, you're a bit confused as to where to go. Then you realize if you want to eat a full service sit down meal, head to the left - we didn't want to do this, but the food that I was eyeing from afar looked good. To the right is their bakery, which has some pretty appetizing cakes, cookies and desserts. Then there is this counter where you deduce that you order ""to go"" meals. We were overwhelmed by the menu but managed to pull ourselves together in time to order. We both had that initial panic attack of ""oh crap, I have never been here and the menu is longer than a 5 year old's Christmas list and I don't even know where to start because suddenly I feel like I can't even read English."" Deep breath. It's not actually that overwhelming, just a tad unorganized. After ordering, we were instructed to walk all the way across the bakery to a random counter to pay. It was so random the way they had it set up, but we did as we were told and then we waited.

My husband's sandwich took a while to make....again, I don't know how Bodo's does it, but Chompie's is probably 4 times slower. Or is it more appropriate to say that Bodo's is 4 times as fast? Whatever. Either way, Bodo's has the breakfast bagel process down perfectly. Waiting was fine, though...we weren't in a rush. When my husband's warm sandwich was finally ready, we got our stuff and then headed outside (there is nowhere to eat inside if you don't want to have a full service meal, which is one complaint I would make about this place). Who wants to eat their bagel outside when it's pushing 110 degrees? Not me. Even if I am under a strip mall canopy that provides some shade.

Anyway, his sandwich was actually really tasty - warm and fresh and really yummy. My bagel was not toasted, which I had requested, which was slightly annoying. However, the bagel itself was very good. We will definitely be back for the food, and I totally recommend this place for grabbing some freshly baked bagels or desserts or whatever. They do have a deli counter as well (meats, cheese, etc). Our breakfast was less than $8 without drinks - fair enough.

I just wish that the layout were a little better and that it was more efficient. I also wish I could have eaten inside. Next time we will likely just do the full service thing.

In the end, it seems that nothing will ever compare to our beloved Bodo's in Charlottesville, Virginia.",food awesom servic suffici layout best stop chompi past friday morn way town long weekend husband obsess breakfast bagel particular breakfast bagel amaz joint make absolut best breakfast bagel ever colleg hometown alway search place good bodo well even good bodo would never find bodo effici bagel store earth liter line peopl servic minut cheap decid give chompi whirl love locat like everyth els arizona tuck strip mall howev enough park found fine walk bit confus go realiz want eat full servic sit meal head left want food eye afar look good right bakeri pretti appet cake cooki dessert counter deduc order go meal overwhelm menu manag pull togeth order initi panic attack oh crap never menu longer year old christma list even know start suddenli feel like even english deep breath actual overwhelm tad unorgan order instruct walk way across bakeri random counter pay random way set told wait husband sandwich took make know bodo chompi probabl time slower appropri say bodo time fast whatev either way bodo breakfast bagel process perfectli wait fine though rush husband warm sandwich final readi got stuff head outsid nowher eat insid want full servic meal complaint would make place want eat bagel outsid push degre even strip mall canopi provid shade anyway sandwich actual realli tasti warm fresh realli yummi bagel toast request slightli annoy howev bagel good definit back food total recommend place grab freshli bake bagel dessert whatev deli counter well meat chees etc breakfast less without drink fair enough wish layout littl better effici also wish could eaten insid next like full servic end seem noth ever compar belov bodo charlottesvil virginia,0

"This dairy sells fresh milk, straight from the cow.  That's what they're licensed to sell.  They use organic feed (dried grasses), hydrogen peroxide for cleaning certain things, and iodine to clean the cows' teats (just like many dairies used to).  They want the cows to be out on pasture, but they need a bigger piece of land to do so.  If you know of a piece of land in the area, please suggest it to Jackie Calamos.  I love their milk.  As of this date, milk is $10/gallon, the true cost of the milk (or maybe even a little low).  Most of the milk you buy in the store isn't worth the price.  Forcing more production out of cows with hormones comes at the cost of quality (and your health).  SYD's has all the good stuff (the proof is in the taste).

"Definitely one of my new favorite restaurants!

A friend and I went to lunch there last week and it was even better than I expected after reading the other reviews.  The menu is EXTREMELY extensive.  The b-fast all day long is a plus, but I wasn't in the mood for that this time so I stuck to the lunch menu.  I ended up ordering the half sandwich and soup of the day and my friend and I split a side order of sweet potato fries.  The eggplant and roasted veggie sandwich was really good, but huge and messy!  I ended up eating a lot of bread and then eating the insides that fell out with a fork after wards.  Delicious nonetheless.  The homemade chicken noodle soup was outstanding!  It had lots of other bits of veggies that are not traditionally in the soup (red pepper, green pepper, corn, etc.) and it added to the soup quite nicely.  Did I forget to mention it's a GIGANTIC bowl of soup?  There's no little cup o' soup here - come hungry!  The fries were delicious although we didn't even need them since our meals were ""Hungry Man"" sized.

Some side notes:

1.  Parking is awful for lunch.  If you don't mind creepily stalking folks in the parking lot and possibly engaging in an altercation with another patron attempting to park, go ahead and give it the good ol' college try.

2.  I ordered a water with lemon.  I received a water with no lemon.  When I asked for some lemons for my water, they brought me out a small plate with SIX (yes, I really did say six) overgrown lemon wedges.  I tried to come up with a scenario where one person would possibly have a need for one entire lemon on steroids.  I couldn't come up with one.  There is no reason for one person to be in possession of that much lemon.  Period.

3.  We walked in and staff #1 seated us.  Staff #2 took our order.  Staff #3 brought our drinks and later the pile of lemons.  Staff #4 brought our meal.  Staff #5 cleared our plates.  Staff #6 brought our check.  Staff #3 took our check and brought the receipts/change back.  Did it really take 6 people to get us through a weekday lunch?  I was mostly entertained by it - it almost became a game of ""who will show up next and what is their task?""  It was still a little ridiculous.

4.  Being a semi-health conscious diner, I loved that they had fat free dressings, made tuna salad with low fat mayo, and just had many, many more healthy options than the average restaurant.  I appreciate places that can fix a good meal without drenching it in calories and fat.  There are plenty of places to go for that sort of meal when you're in need.  No shortage there.  It's nice to have those options beyond the standard no dressing, burger wrapped in lettuce, or vegetable medley consisting of zucchini, carrots, and cauliflower.  A big up for Taylor's.

5.  For a half sandwich with soup, half of the fries, tax, and tip I paid about $16.  It's not the cheapest lunch in town, but it's worth what you pay for.  Just remember that the portions are gargantuan so no need to order a lot of extras to fill you up.

"Never. Again. *hork* 

I have been to this location a couple of times. My friends LOVE this place, and I really wanted to at least like it. But here I sit typing out my review and fighting the urge to double over the trash can at my desk. I can't remember the last time I felt so sick! 

A few things about last night's dinner stand out...as negative. But I'll start with the positive, which bumped the review up from 1 star to 2. 

POSITIVE: 

Our waitress was very friendly and chipper. 

NEGATIVE: 

But alas, it was not enough. We ordered edamame, 4 rolls and a couple of sake bombers...um...but the ""shot glass"" was too big to fit in the glass...so that no worky. 

The waitress asked if we wanted everything to come at once or if she should bring them out as they were prepared...we chose the latter... 

1) we never got our edamame, 

2) it took 30 minutes before the first roll came out (with no wasabi or ginger??), the next 2 rolls took an additional 30 minutes, and the 4th roll was about 5-10 minutes after that... 

3) the spicy yellowtail (roll #3) had obviously turned, it smelled like bad fish, which I unfortunately didn't realize until it had already made it's way into my mouth...I felt instantly sick and haven't been right since then, which means I didn't even get to enjoy a taste of the 4th roll because I didn't trust it anymore. 

POSITIVE: 

She took the yellowtail off our bill...which seems like it would be a no-brainer, but you never know these days. 

NEGATIVE: 

No apology for serving us bad fish, and no acknowledgment from the mgr on duty, which should be standard operating procedure at a restaurant. 

Also, the acoustics are not conducive to having any sort of conversation. The music was at a decent level, but for some reason, the place is just REALLY loud. 

And finally, and this is just a matter of personal preference, I'm not a fan of the seating arrangement. It's set up in a way so that you are rubbing elbows with other parties and unable to avoid being all up in their kool-aid... 

POSITIVE:

"Bosa Donuts at Southern and Mcklintock in Tempe is part of a strip mall that I have been visiting since I was just a kid. Except, back then, Bosa Donuts was a Taco Bell. A few years back Taco Bell moved a half mile down the road into a new building and Bosa Donuts set up shop. About a year ago I discovered another new store in this strip mall which is Fallout Games, an awesome video game store. For this entire last year I've been driving past Bosa on my way out of the complex after visiting Fallout Games and taking a curious look as I drive by but until this week I had never tried it. After reading all the positive Yelp reviews, I had to give it a go.

Well, first off, It's 24 hours, which is huge in my book since I'm almost always up until four or five in the morning. The drive through display is lighted and shows their menu but you have to actually order by pulling up to the window. Since I was there at 3am I asked what was fresh at the moment and the guy was very patient and helpful with listing off what he had available. I just got a few frosted donuts (or raised, as they call them) and was on my way. Right off the bat, I noticed the box was pretty heavy. I only ordered a half dozen but it felt at least as heavy as it does when I get a dozen at Dunkin Donuts. When I got home, I opened the box and realized their donuts are at least thirty percent bigger than Dunkin Donuts of Krispy Kreme.

"I have to admit, the reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 3 is a) I want it to stay in business (which can be hard on Mill these days!) and b) It's one of the few places on Mill where you can bring your child without feeling like you may get heckled. ;) lol Now, I definately enjoy a night out without the babes too, but this is a place I go for happy hour with my husband and daughter.

"I heart Sky Harbor Airport Parking...

Of course, it's always nice to find a ride to or from the airport but when you're all out of favors and you have only yourself to rely on, it comes down to driving yourself or getting a taxi.  Sky Harbor Parking to the rescue.  

For $8 a day or cheaper if you print the coupons from their website, the folks at Sky Harbor Parking make it easy to drop your car and get to your gate in no time... and I've used them a handful of times solo and with the BF so I know it's door-to-door consistent service.  

If you are interested in covered parking, call ahead, but otherwise, just drive over to Washington and 40th and they will take care of you from there.  Also, I recommend calling from the airport once you have your bags and they are always good about picking you up within minutes to take you back to your car.

I hope you'll find Sky Harbor Airport Parking as useful and convenient as I do... safe travels!",heart sky harbor airport park cours alway nice find ride airport favor reli come drive get taxi sky harbor park rescu day cheaper print coupon websit folk sky harbor park make easi drop car get gate use hand time solo bf know door door consist servic interest cover park call ahead otherwis drive washington th take care also recommend call airport bag alway good pick within minut take back car hope find sky harbor airport park use conveni safe travel,0

"We went here on a Saturday afternoon and this place was incredibly empty.  They had brunch specials going on, including $2 bloody mary's and mimosas, but we were more in the mood for lunch.  Except for the bloody mary, I had to try one.  It came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  Boo!  But it was really tasty. Yay!  The hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had Arrogant Bastard, and he got a 22 oz bottle for $4.75.  Hey, that's not fair!!

Next up: the wings.  We were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are ""seasoned"" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  We did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  These non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  The seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  If I were in the mood for the tang and kick of Frank's Hot Sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.

My entree was the Tilapia salad, and I was a bit disappointed.  The fish was a bit dry and uninspired. And the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  I ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and Mandarin oranges, but I had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.

"The Phoenix metro area is definitely not known for authentic Asian cuisine. China Magic Noodle House, however, is the real deal. This place reminds me of the Taiwanese delis that I used to go to in LA, as well as noodle houses that I've frequented in Taipei.

They have a great selection of cold noodle, hot noodle and soup noodle dishes. And, a variety of ways to have your noodles (I typically order the thick noodles or shaved noodles). There's always a veggie on the whiteboard to try and the fried tofu is very tender and tasty with the dipping sauce.

If you're looking for a reasonably priced, ethnically authentic meal in Phoenix (especially the East Valley), China Magic Noodle House should be near the top, if not first, on your list. the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isn't enough choices where chicken is the main protein.",phoenix metro area definit known authent asian cuisin china magic noodl hous howev real deal place remind taiwanes deli use go la well noodl hous frequent taipei great select cold noodl hot noodl soup noodl dish varieti way noodl typic order thick noodl shave noodl alway veggi whiteboard tri fri tofu tender tasti dip sauc look reason price ethnic authent meal phoenix especi east valley china magic noodl hous near top first list neg would place enough choic chicken main protein,0

"Are you one who likes the smell of a brand new car? How about the smell, or in this case, lack of smell, of a brand new gym? Now, for a limited time, a completely unsullied 24 Hour Fitness, at the MetroCenter, of all places.

At its current new state (it's been open for a week), this 24 Hour is in much better condition than the one on Camelback. No surprise there - everything inside here is brand spanking new.

The details:

* In contrast to other 24 Hours in the Valley, this one actually will remain open 24/7 (versus closing at night on the weekends). The guy at the front desk said this is due to how this location is zoned vs the other ones.

* The cardio area is equipped with 11 flatscreen TVs hanging from the ceiling, with one even tuned into soccer-centric GolTV (which means one less tuned to all those talking heads on brainless cable news stations - bonus). 

* The adjoining weight area is larger than the Camelback location and currently has all its dumbbells in place on the correct shelves, and all its weight machines are working. No new types of machines, though (this is a 24 Hour Fitness after all) but still all the standards, plus four flat benches and four incline benches.   

* Full basketball court (which could also be split into two half-sized courts). Camelback lacks this.

* Large stretch/ab area which also includes some contraption straight out of Tron/Blade Runner. I stood there and looked at all the diagrams, acknowledged that it must be useful, and walked away.

* Standard group X classroom, childcare

* A spotless pool area. If you've been to many 24 Hour Fitness, you'll know that this is a hugely appreciated factor. I anticipate it's not going to remain spotless for long, but doing laps in a crystal clear pool was awesome. No dankness here (yet). 

* Spotless lockerroom with wood-paneled lockers and branded Dial Ultimate Clean hair & body wash. I'm assuming the women's lockerroom has their own corporate soap sponsor (I find all this a little odd, but go figure).  But beyond soap, there's some contraption called SuitMate which is like a salad spinner for your swim trunks. Just throw your trunks inside it, press down, and in 30 seconds your trunks are water-free. How awesome is that?

* Is going here after work safe for your car, you ask? Well, when I left the gym two hours later at around 9:45 pm, my car was still there in the parking lot, untouched. Seems like the MetroCenter is full of surprises.

* All in all, a great gym that I'm sure will be a welcome addition to the area. However, it still rates 4 stars since:

A) Although all the equipment is brand new and the latest edition of everything, there is fitness equipment at other gym chains that this one is lacking. 

B) I'm anticipating what the gym will be like in 6 months. If it manages to stay as clean as it is now by that time, maybe a 5th star will be in order.",like smell brand new car smell case lack smell brand new gym limit complet unsulli hour fit metrocent place current new state open week hour much better condit camelback surpris everyth insid brand spank new detail contrast hour valley actual remain open versu close night weekend guy front desk said due locat zone vs one cardio area equip flatscreen tv hang ceil even tune soccer centric goltv mean less tune talk head brainless cabl news station bonu adjoin weight area larger camelback locat current dumbbel place correct shelv weight machin work new type machin though hour fit still standard plu four flat bench four inclin bench full basketbal court could also split two half size court camelback lack larg stretch ab area also includ contrapt straight tron blade runner stood look diagram acknowledg must use walk away standard group x classroom childcar spotless pool area mani hour fit know huge appreci factor anticip go remain spotless long lap crystal clear pool awesom dank yet spotless lockerroom wood panel locker brand dial ultim clean hair bodi wash assum women lockerroom corpor soap sponsor find littl odd go figur beyond soap contrapt call suitmat like salad spinner swim trunk throw trunk insid press second trunk water free awesom go work safe car ask well left gym two hour later around pm car still park lot untouch seem like metrocent full surpris great gym sure welcom addit area howev still rate star sinc although equip brand new latest edit everyth fit equip gym chain lack b anticip gym like month manag stay clean mayb th star order,0

The place was pleasantly busy but not overcrowded. We ordered at the counter and out food came out pretty quickly. We tried the gyro pita as well as the gyro plate. We cleared our plates in no time so I guess that means the food was good, right? 

The gyro meat was tasty, moist and flavorful. The rice was delicious and the tzatziki sauce was refreshing. We decided that we'd be going back for future lunch dates whenever possible. Besides, you can't have too many go to Greek spots in my opinion so this one's definitely going in our books.

"Hey, its difficult to find anything particularly wrong with this stadium, which is especially remarkable coming from an obstinate sports fan who intends to hate before he loves.  

Immediate impressions of the stadium are that it is very well-designed and constructed with fan comfort in mind.  Chase nails this aspect solidly.  The concourse are rife with eating and drinking options.  You literally cannot walk 10 steps without tasty, delicious stadium food beckoning your fat ass to indulge; polish dogs, ice cream, 24 oz. bottled beer; Peter fucking Piper Pizza (Mmmmmm!).  The concourse also opens up brilliantly into the field of play, and one can go take a break from the seats but still have the ability to watch the action on the field.  Very important feature, particularly with baseball where sitting down can become monotonous.  

The actual field of play is marvelously constructed, with modern and classic designs colliding.  The dirt path from the mound to the plate is a throwback to the 30s, while the pool in the outfield adds a very unique and ""Arizona"" touch.  Pretty damn cool.  The classic clockface in centerfield is beautiful, and the grade of the stands are perfect for the noise to reflect off the metal structure.  Now that its under new management, they are opening the roof much more, which is a HUGE plus.  Many fans have been complaining about the lack of open air since the stadium opened.

So two things that I don't like about the stadium, one ornamental, the other functional.  

First, the hokey, 90s-esque mosaic on the outfield slats.  Jesus.  How about an update?  Its just looks so fucking bad, its almost embarrassing, and has prevented the outside of this architectural masterpiece from aging with grace.  How about HUUUGE pictures of current players, or true windows to let the light in and perhaps a view of the distant skyline?  This would require, of course, for PHX to actually knock down the Garage Mahal and actually build an outfield skyline.

This leads me to problem #2, the aforementioned ""Garage Mahal"", the most deplorable, atrocious boner yet for our mentally-ill city planners and officials.  What a total fucking waste to build the most useless and overly enormous parking garage that ultimately discourages people from walking through downtown before and after the game, restricted the potential for bars and restaurants to be placed there instead (fuck, they didn't even give the option for ground level retail), and mostly sits at 1% capacity on non-baseball-days.  That would be 284 days of uselessness.  

Though this isn't the D-backs fault, it is a result of stadium proximity, so as a penalty, combined with those silly mosaics, it loses a star and red pigment.

Overall, however, Chase field is the tits and will eventually be a MLB classic.",hey difficult find anyth particularli wrong stadium especi remark come obstin sport fan intend hate love immedi impress stadium well design construct fan comfort mind chase nail aspect solidli concours rife eat drink option liter cannot walk step without tasti delici stadium food beckon fat ass indulg polish dog ice cream oz bottl beer peter fuck piper pizza mmmmmm concours also open brilliantli field play go take break seat still abil watch action field import featur particularli basebal sit becom monoton actual field play marvel construct modern classic design collid dirt path mound plate throwback pool outfield add uniqu arizona touch pretti damn cool classic clockfac centerfield beauti grade stand perfect nois reflect metal structur new manag open roof much huge plu mani fan complain lack open air sinc stadium open two thing like stadium ornament function first hokey esqu mosaic outfield slat jesu updat look fuck almost embarrass prevent outsid architectur masterpiec age grace huuug pictur current player true window let light perhap view distant skylin would requir cours phx actual knock garag mahal actual build outfield skylin lead problem aforement garag mahal deplor atroci boner yet mental ill citi planner offici total fuck wast build useless overli enorm park garag ultim discourag peopl walk downtown game restrict potenti bar restaur place instead fuck even give option ground level retail mostli sit capac non basebal day would day useless though back fault result stadium proxim penalti combin silli mosaic lose star red pigment overal howev chase field tit eventu mlb classic,1

Since this was on my boyfriends card, and he didn't want to push for the the Cabana Balcony we wanted, there was nothing I could do. However, I find this highly unacceptable. 

2. Dirty - Every morning, when we left, there were used coffee mugs and coffee pots on the floor in the area in front of the maintenance closet. 

3. Maintenance crew would leave their carts in the middle of the hallway, and we would have to figure out how to move them to get by.

But then something happened....my date gave the server his card to pay for the meal and it was brought back as not able to be processed (yikes!).  The server also informed him that they'd been able to process someone else's but one other didn't go through.  My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, but had just enough cash to cover the tab, not really enough for a tip.  So he asked the server if they would try to put a lesser amount on the card to cover the tip and take the cash.  This is when the server informed us that the machine might be down and it wasn't just his it was everyone's! So he kinda lied earlier, which wasn't cool.  We then waited another 30 minutes without an appearance by the server to explain what was going on, although I could see Marcellino working on the machine, even trying his own card.  My date got up to go speak with him, and the server tried to divert him, but he was respectful and wanted to speak with the owner.  No attempt was made to really apologize for the delay or make up for the wait...so they wrote down his information and address to mail him a receipt.

"How can I not show yelp love for the original fro yo shop that kept my addiction fulfilled in the early days of the fro yo phenomenon? Yes, that is what Golden Spoon is to me. 

When I first moved to Phoenix from college, I was coming from an area that was overloaded with frozen yogurt shops for the college girls who shared my love of the frozen treat. Unfortunately, Phoenix hadn't quite yet jumped on the bandwagon and so the only choice was Golden Spoon. To make matters worse, the only locations were north on Shea or South in Awatukee. So, since I was living in Old Town, the Shea location was typically my choice. 

I can say that I added several miles on my car very willingly to treat my taste buds to Golden Spoon. Yes, it was the closest shop to me but it's also creamy and completely delicious. The frozen yogurt is served by staff and comes in different sizes. You can choose from multiple toppings and it's just your ""old fashioned"" frozen yogurt shop. I'm using old fashioned very loosely in this sense, since frozen yogurt is anything but old fashioned, but with the self-serf trend, Golden Spoon is ""old fashioned"" compared to that.

For the first course, I debated between the crispy shrimp and the chopped salad and based on the waiters recommendation, I ordered the chopped salad with avocado, crispy vegetables and parmesan. Loved the huge chunks of avocado in it! 

For the second course, I ordered the tortelli (a version of tortellini). It was the perfect size, not too big, not too small. Enough for one person. It was delicious! It was stuffed with artichoke and cheese and was heavenly. I wish I had the recipe so I could attempt to make it at home. 

The dessert of Peanut Butter Cup was equally delicious. It's not what you'd expect it to be: it's smooth and creamy with a hint of chocolate, but it's damn good! I was so full from my meal and couldn't finish all of it so I asked the waiter to scoop it out into a to-go box for me and he laughed, but happily packed it up.

"Accidently discovered this place because of the Chinese New Year/Vietnamese Tet Festival of this year.. very nice surprise that the buns here are bigger and have more filling than the buns at Lee Lee's Market. I know, I know, there are probably many more places in AZ that sells these, but I honestly don't know of any other places that sell these other than Mekong Plaza (here) and Lee Lee's in Chandler. 

It's around $1.30-1.40 a bun and they seem very fresh because the times that I've came by, someone is preparing and cooking them in large ovens in the back. Very nice that it is located by the Asian market and shops. They have a frequent buyer card you can pick up in the front (for every $100 you spend, you get $10 off your next bakery purchase).

It's been almost a full year since my initial review of Bacon, and I've been back probably ten times or more.

I've seen a lot of transition with the employees but I can say that their service has gotten much better since the beginning.  The casual atmosphere is right up my alley for a weekend breakfast, and my yogi omelette / protein pancake orders have stayed consistent too.  

I was there earlier today and while the service was spot-on, I did find a piece of ham in my otherwise veggie omelette - but I overlooked it and enjoyed my meal nonetheless...

"I've been to a few Ren Faires in various states (my favorite is in Larkspur, CO), and this is towards the top of my list.

First of all, they have their shit together. From signs all down 60 assuring you that you're going the right way, to having a specific Ren Faire lane to a plethora of parking attendants, everything was organized perfectly.

Before I talk about the Faire itself, I have to say I was incredibly impressed at how disability accessible this place was. Between tons and tons of handicap park, ramps into each store, first aid people walking around with red cross flags so you knew where the first aid was, and even handicap reserved seating at the joust.  I give them an A+ on that.

The shops were great; found an excellent variety of things for sale.  I got a great cane, candles, incense, jewelry and more. Food was good too; lots of veggie and meat options. We got broccoli cheese soup in a bread bowl (soup was ok, bread bowl was super delicious!), falafel (good), chocolate covered nut rolls (delicious!) and a good juicy pickle.   Drinks were huge for the $3 we paid, and could be found all over.

I also liked how much seating there was, both in sun and shade.  We were able to stay longer because of being able to take breaks.

The staff themselves were nice, but I didn't feel that many of them were as ""into"" their rolls as other faires I've been to.  I'd say ""good morrow"" and get ""how are you doing?"" in return.  Not a big deal, but just would have bumped it up to 5 stars.

Worth the $18 the tickets were at Frys? Yes, but just barely.

"I love that walking through the doors of the Sugar Bowl is like taking a step back in time but what I don't love is that it looks like it hasn't been cleaned or had any restoration work done since the day it opened. Lets be honest though, I didn't come here for the decor, I came for the ice cream. 

I was very excited when I saw the sundae covered in chocolate, cherries and marshmallow creme. I love marshmallow creme and chocolate, always a recipe for success when these two ingredients are combined. Well, no luck. They were out of marshmallow creme.

As a matter of fact, I don't really feel comfortable in Neiman's - it's extremely 'fancy' and high end for me.  But, I've gone in a handful of times and even bought a dress or two on sale at Neiman's in the past.  I admit, the quality associated with the designer labels at this store is pretty amazing.

Anyways, I felt some major pressure to register at Neiman's from my mom, so I met my mother-in-law-to-be at this Neiman's location on Sunday.

"We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.) In all fairness, I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and ""come back and try us again."" He made no effort to ""make things right"" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre.

"Always love the ALofts
If you've stayed at one, they're pretty much the same
Rooms were clean and comfortable.
There was plenty of room in the standard king room
Bathroom was nice, you don't have to deal with the miniature shampoos, they're in the wall mounted containers, which is nice.
Only thing missing is an iron and ironing board, but other than that, the room was perfect, especially if you like hip, modern decor, which I do.  Rooms are a notch above TheStandard in LA, but not quite as roomy.  The rest of the property was just OK, yes, they have a lounge, but need a restaurant.  This location also does not have a DJ as some of the other ALofts do.

"What an unbelievable night we had at Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse. Everything we ate was top notch, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is spectacular. How many steakhouses play Jim Croce, Beatles, and Beach Boys? It's a very welcome change.

It's dark, it's sexy, and it's probably the best steakhouse in Arizona. 

The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters, crab legs, claws, and huge shrimp. My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat I've had all year. Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well. I'm not a dessert person, but the warm butter cake should be illegal it's so good. I was stuffed already when it came to the table, and then I ate all of it. 

The only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp, and when I told the waiter don't worry about it he said ok, and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on it's own bed of ice.

"Simple but really great cajun food prepared in steamers right in front of you.  Selections include gumbo, pan roasts (a tomato-based broth with chunks of seafood), or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp, crab, chicken, crawfish, oysters, or all five, with rice. They also have fresh oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktails, salads, and tasty seafood chowder, as well as the occasional lobster special. I've been probably 20 times and still never had a bad dish. The staff is friendly and helpful, and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste. By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.

As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor. This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still, it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $25 for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.

"Here is the thing about JoJo's, its in a neighbor were you eat at chain joints or you cook at home. It seemed like a safe bet, and who doesn't want to support their neighborhood pizza place?

They started off on the wrong foot with me by not accepting their free pizza coupon they had sent me in the mail. I had called before hand and asked if it was valid, was told it was, and then was not given a free pizza. Instead, I was given a discount on another pizza. So, instead of coming home with two, which was the plan, I got one for cheap. I didn't want one for cheap. I wanted two. 

The food itself is typical. The crust, cheese and toppings are average, sloppy in a bad way. The sauce is a bit to sweet for my liking, but having eaten here twice, has tasted different each time. The service was alright, delivery took about an hour on a Friday. 

The rest of the menu, aside from the pizza, is what you would imagine. Wings (not remarkable), fried items and some sandwiches.

"When you walk into Sky Harbor, you are bombarded with declarations that it's the country's ""friendliest airport"". Huh. What does this mean? User-friendly? Friendly in a ""you'll always feel at home here"" way? Didn't really know, but it seems extremely important to their PR group, since when you sign on for the wi-fi, you can't change pages until you rate how friendly the airport is from a drop down menu. 

It might be doing a disservice by proclaiming it as the superlative of congeniality. Expectations run high -- at least by me. I found the free wi-fi extremely friendly. Yeah!! Star for that. I found the den-like check in area (at least in Terminal 3), not so friendly as it left me feeling a little depressed. The TSA officer who confiscated my 4 oz (apparenly it's 3.4 oz in PHX) Neutrogena sun screen not so friendly...but not malicious, and I guess I wouldnt be so friendly if I were charged with monitoring tenths of ounces hour after hour. The spoke-security system I found to be not so friendly to both users and retail. I never like seeing a plethora of places to purchase items BEFORE security, leaving you with only a few outlets for you to browse in your little concourse. I hate wondering, what do gates 1-14 get to purchase? Is my concourse more vacant than the others? Just put security before ALL the retail and let us wander a bit.

"This place is essentially a copy of the old Father's Office (www.fathersoffice.com) in Brentwood, CA.  It took me a while to get over that fact and give it a decent try.  Among the things Delux has copied from FO is the famous ""Office Burger,"" which Delux calls the ""Delux Burger.""  They also bring out the fries in a shopping cart just like Father's Office.  What Delux fails to copy, however, is the quality of the food and the high-end nature of the original.  At FO, the wines changed weekly and are all incredibly rare selections.  The beers at FO also tend towards the more obscure.  Delux seems to concentrate almost exclusively on beers and does have a decent selection, but nothing you can't find elsewhere.  Wines are available, but as an afterthought, and definitely not of the quality served at FO.  For Phoenicians who never experienced the joys associated with the original Father's Office, you're missing out.  It's like being an Eric Clapton fan but not even knowing who Muddy Waters is.  But all the imitation aside, I have to say that Delux does a pretty good job with everything and they have taken the FO concept and adapted it to the PHX strip mall environment.  

Food wise, everything I have tried was ok.  They did change their sweet potato fries a year or two ago because the other ones weren't ""crispy"" enough.  The problem is that these new crispier ones have no flavor.  When they were testing out the new fries, the manager asked me and a friend to opine and we told him the truth: We said the new ones are flavorless.  I guess we were the only ones who thought so because they went ahead with that change.  That lost them 1 star from this review.  I would rather have the soggier more flavorful ones (who knows how they make these new ones so crispy anyways?).  

When I go here, it's almost always out of convenience and late at night.  Not many places of this caliber stay open until 2 am, so it's about all there is when you are in need of a late night meal in this part of town.  Their 2 star rating is based on: clearly knocking off one of my favorite places, Father's Office (minus 1 star) and for ignoring my feedback on the new crispy tasteless sweet potato fries (minus 1 star).  They also lose a star for retaining the FO prices but substituting Phoenix strip mall quality.",place essenti copi old father offic www fathersoffic com brentwood ca took get fact give decent tri among thing delux copi fo famou offic burger delux call delux burger also bring fri shop cart like father offic delux fail copi howev qualiti food high end natur origin fo wine chang weekli incred rare select beer fo also tend toward obscur delux seem concentr almost exclus beer decent select noth find elsewher wine avail afterthought definit qualiti serv fo phoenician never experienc joy associ origin father offic miss like eric clapton fan even know muddi water imit asid say delux pretti good job everyth taken fo concept adapt phx strip mall environ food wise everyth tri ok chang sweet potato fri year two ago one crispi enough problem new crispier one flavor test new fri manag ask friend opin told truth said new one flavorless guess one thought went ahead chang lost star review would rather soggier flavor one know make new one crispi anyway go almost alway conveni late night mani place calib stay open need late night meal part town star rate base clearli knock favorit place father offic minu star ignor feedback new crispi tasteless sweet potato fri minu star also lose star retain fo price substitut phoenix strip mall qualiti,0

"I love Tasty Kabob!  Their food is always excellent, and I try to make it back there whenever I return to the Valley.  I always order their chicken shish kabob entree, which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables.  The chicken is always tender, well-marinated, and equally well-seasoned.  Their beef shish kabob entree is also very good. Try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor, or just enjoy it as is.  It's difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes, but their hummus is always creamy and smooth, and I love their shirazi salad.

"This is a cool place for low key hanging out, killing time, chatting and relaxing with friends.  It is NOT a good night spot and doesn't work as an event venue like they seem to be trying to make it.

I've attended 2 events there and its basically a disaster in trying to make your way through the 200-300 patrons they bring in.  You get funneled in past the food trailer into the bar area which is packed with people standing among several oversized tables.  Only if you've been there before can you figure out that you can walk towards the boxing ring past the crowd to get behind the stage and into the retail area.  Once there you have to get a spot among the wares to watch the back (or the side) of the show that is going to take place facing the bar.  Both times I stood the entire night with my drink next to a display of $50 t-shirts.  Very nerve wracking and annoying.

1.  The old timey way they make drinks is very cool and the drinks are delicious but I have waited now 35 and 45 minutes each on different nights to actually get a single mixed cocktail.  Its insane how slow it is.

2.  There are rules to what you can get at which station.  One spot is just wine.  Another spot is just mixed drinks.  Lemonade - oh thats a different place entirely.  

3.  They use the boxing ring as the ""stage"" for shows.  Very hard to view the show there because of the odd angle its at.  Both times I've had to stand in the retail area while the performers faced the seating/bar area (which only seats about 75 people).

To pay more than $10 to see a performance at this place is outrageous.  If the owners want to be an event venue they could do it simply by doing some rearranging and investing in some more seating.",cool place low key hang kill chat relax friend good night spot work event venu like seem tri make attend event basic disast tri make way patron bring get funnel past food trailer bar area pack peopl stand among sever overs tabl figur walk toward box ring past crowd get behind stage retail area get spot among ware watch back side show go take place face bar time stood entir night drink next display shirt nerv wrack annoy old timey way make drink cool drink delici wait minut differ night actual get singl mix cocktail insan slow rule get station spot wine anoth spot mix drink lemonad oh that differ place entir box ring stage show hard view show odd angl time stand retail area perform face seat bar area seat peopl pay see perform place outrag owner want event venu could simpli rearrang invest seat,1

"I went here with a friend to use a Groupon for a gel manicure and a spa pedicure. I knew it was a school going into the appointment. My issues with the place are as follows:
1. The students there were very unprofessional. They talked about their personal lives, talked to each other, and just were generally inappropriate for a business setting. Their supervisor overheard everything and did not say anything. This is pretty disturbing since some of these girls stated that they were going to work at places like Dolce in a few weeks. 
2. The gel manicure was billed as 'unchippable' by the people at this salon, but my friend had one whole nail peel off the day after the manicure and my nails chipped 2 days after. This is especially annoying because it is difficult to remove the polish that remained on my nails, so they just look bad. 
3. The massage was pretty weak. 
4. They don't have enough carts for pedicures, so I had to put my foot up on my 'pedicurist's' lap...that's a bit odd. 
5. It was difficult to make an appointment here. I had to call several times and leave messages and wait for them to call me back. 


Overall, I would not return to this place, even at the cheap price.

"If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars.  But, I'm not  rating it based on the food.  It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but won't split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote ""family style"".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served ""family style"" someone else may get what you ordered and you won't have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was ""this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties"".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, I'm pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I don't normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.  The reservation was made for 25 people!  It would've taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.

"My wife and I were having a lousy day and we needed somewhere to eat. We happened to drive past Stax and decided to give it a try. Once we sat down, our moods immediately improved. Our waiter was friendly, funny and attentive, without being overbearing or annoying. I was happy to see a decent selection of beers with a healthy dose of local brews. I immediately ordered an Oak Creek Nut Brown.

Our waiter quickly brought our drinks and glasses of water with cucumber slices. The cucumber added a nice cooling touch on a hot summer day.

We ordered the sweet potato fries and I ordered a seafood burger, which on that particular day was shrimp. The sweet potato fries were excellent, fried just right and lightly seasoned with kosher salt. Even without the homemade ketchup, the fries were a delight.

My burger was tasty, with the shrimp lightly breaded and seasoned with a kicky teriyaki sauce and served on the bun with lettuce and thin strips of carrots. Also, the bun was very soft and tasty.

The only issue with Stax is the price. The burgers are more like tapas, in that they're small (3 oz). But, each burger ranges from $4 to $7, depending on the type of meat. A hungry person could easily eat three burgers, so plan to spend a decent amount of money if you want a large meal here.

Overall, a fun place to grab a lighter bite to eat.",wife lousi day need somewher eat happen drive past stax decid give tri sat mood immedi improv waiter friendli funni attent without overbear annoy happi see decent select beer healthi dose local brew immedi order oak creek nut brown waiter quickli brought drink glass water cucumb slice cucumb ad nice cool touch hot summer day order sweet potato fri order seafood burger particular day shrimp sweet potato fri excel fri right lightli season kosher salt even without homemad ketchup fri delight burger tasti shrimp lightli bread season kicki teriyaki sauc serv bun lettuc thin strip carrot also bun soft tasti issu stax price burger like tapa small oz burger rang depend type meat hungri person could easili eat three burger plan spend decent amount money want larg meal overal fun place grab lighter bite eat,0

"I don't know of a single Phoenician who wasn't absolutely ecstatic about Hanny's opening.  We were all excited for this cool new ""destination.""  The husband and I were the second pair of people to walk through their doors.  There were literally hoards of employees working at the time.  There were about 15 upstairs staring at us, about 5 at the bar, and 15 or so more servers just chillin around the restaurant.  Somehow, with all these people, they managed to completely ignore us for most of our meal.  Making a typical 45 minute to 1 hour dinner experience turn into a 2 hour ordeal.

The decor of this place is beautiful.  Cool, clean, and modern.  The music fluctuates from being too loud and inappropriate for the setting to being perfect with an eclectic but well blended mix. 

The pizza is decent, but very appetizer-ish.  It is cracker thin, which turns a lot of people off, but I actually like it.  The onion strings are to die for when they aren't completely grease laden.  That's an off and on thing, not really consistent.  I don't like their sandwiches.  They are unimaginative and bland.  There really isn't a lot to choose from on the menu.

Unfortunately both times we brought friends along with us, the place was a buzz kill, and I am not really sure why.  Maybe we will try the place again now that it has been open for a while.

I think I was one of the 20 women (not including the waitresses) in Tilted Kilt yesterday.
It was raining men.  And I liked it. 
A few minutes after entering the bar, I knew exactly why I was surrounded by a sea of men- the waitresses were barely wearing any clothes. 
Let me clarify: they did have tiny skirts on, even tinier tops and their bras were hanging out, so I guess that constitutes as clothes.
The outfits were cute, but extremely revealing, so much so that even I had a hard time looking our waitress in the eye and I know the guys around me were having the same problem.
The bartenders (all men) were all pretty cute. And wearing kilts.  All I kept thinking yesterday was that they must make some pretty damn good money to warrant wearing a skirt to work.
The food is pretty good too and their menu is extensive.  You'll find the usual apps, sandwiches, tons of salads, chicken fingers, wings and so on.

"Where I live in Tempe, I can walk to the end of my street, hop on an Orbit which takes me to the main Bus Depot or can drop me off closer to the Light Rail stop off of Mill Ave. Not bad, right?

I actually am enjoying the clustering of a real Bus Depot not anywhere near a residential area with plenty of security, lighting, public enough space in an easily accessible location in Tempe. I actually feel safe hanging out here at night and when I ride my bike to the station, all the bike racks face the security and transit office, so never had an issue with my bicycle here either.

The buses themselves are fine, I have had some very bad moments on the bus with the passengers (ie the 1st time I got on a Phoenix bus, a knife-fight broke out and I had to stay for a police report, another time two guys were reading hard porn right across from  me), but its kinda nice mixing with people rather then being in a car-tomb.

What I very much have an issue with is most bus stations. I have had bums passed out (dead?)  on the seat, meth heads, a single sign with no seating in the hot blazing sun (I am looking at you Scottsdale), seats no shade around, fights break out at stations. I try to call the metro, they say it isn't their issue. Call the police non-emergency number, they say its the Metro jurisdiction. For this very bad situation alone, I don't take the bus at night since all the stations near the arts area and central are not well lit, full of sketchy people and the buses take too long to come by (if they even stop).

I like to go out and socialize. I don't care if a place is a little loud or smoky (what do you expect in a bar). I have more fun if there is a good crowd, music I can dance to, and a full service bar that can make all those foo-foo drinks & shots I like.

My boyfriend on the other hand likes places without a lot of noise where he can just hang out, have a conversation and drink beer.

We finally found a place we can go that makes both of us happy: 16thh St Sports bar! This place isn't exactly a sports bar. Its defiantly not a club. Its not dirty, but DIVE would still be an appropriate description.

The dance floor + DJ and pool tables are on one side of the building.  The main bar, main lounge, and the big TVs are on the other side of the building.

My boyfriend can grab a table and hang with friends without having to talk over a lot of noise.

"This, my friends, is THE place to get some very authentic Chinese food. 

The servings are HUGE for what you're paying...shucks, they are huge no matter which way you look at it so be careful not to order too much food unless you want leftovers. Who doesn't like leftover Chinese food anyway?

My recommendations are the Sweet and Sour chicken, the Egg Foo Yung and the chow mein. You will not be disappointed.

You'll also find the soups on the back of the menu at an average of 4 bucks or so. You will be pleasantly surprised when you get the bowl...it can feed at least 6 people. She will bring small bowls out and serve it for you right at the table. Give the hot and sour soup a try.

As for the service, it depends on how you look at it. Don't be afraid to get up and refill your own water. Shoot, the waitress is the only one that's there, give her a break already. She must own the joint with her husband because there is always this little kid in the corner playing on his laptop. So, get your own water and your own take home containers if you want. She doesn't have a problem with it.

Yes, the place is a little worn but you don't go there to look at pretty stuff. It's not dirty, just broke down. You'd be broke down too if you practically gave away your food in abundance to your customers. Who has money for new furniture if you take care of your customers bellies.  The lobster, crab and fish are fresh and cheap. Try finding lobster somewhere else in the valley for 10 bucks a pound, I dare ya. 

So, head on out, just don't go on a Wednesday, that's their day off. They are open 11AM to 11PM every other day though. You can call in your order and pick it up if you don't want to look at the place.

Oh yeah, and if you ever go in there and it smells horrid, it's not the place, it's a popular dish that some customers order called ""Salty Fish"". It stinks to all heck! If that plate comes out I usually pack up my food, giggle and finish my meal at home. I don't mind one bit, that's just the way it is.

Oh and the waitress does speak good English, however, you wont find many Caucasians frequenting this place.

"Alright, so how does it go from being a 1-star (actually, less than that) to being a 3-star review? Simple, they seem better than the last time I was working/shopping here. I went here the other night to help my boyfriend find an interview outfit and noticed that the store had a handful of the same employees as they did back in the Summer, but certain areas of clothing had been moved around. Despite all the moving and switching around they must have done, the store seemed really clean and in order. In fact, I really have no issues with this store except one, teeny tiny, little problem...the check out girl!

I remember her from when I worked here and she gave me attitude when I needed to ask her something. Turns out, it wasn't a one time thing.. she's just a rude person. On this particular night, there were only two check out girls and a line of about 15 people. My boyfriend and I were making seperate purchases and knew one of us was going to get her. I happened to get the friendly one, but before we each paid for our items, we were watching as the rude girl didn't crack even ONE half-hearted attempt at a smile. We listened as she rudely explained to some elderly ladies why a certain item was marked on sale but the same item was normal priced. They wanted to make sure they weren't paying too much/too little and her explanation?: ""That ones been the store longer."" It didn't make sense to them, or to those of us in line watching, but she kept getting huffy about it until they dropped the issue. She shoved people's items in bags and practically threw them at them and said, again without trying to fake some kind of customer service, ""Have a good night. Bye. NEXT!"" Yuck.

My cashier was slightly more frienldy, but still not awesome. It was obvious she was having a long night (afterall, she was stuck at the register with the Ice Queen), so it was understandable. Also, I didn't catch her name, but the girl working in the dressing rooms was really sweet and kept greeting everyone that came by. 

I had to call this location to get the name of the manager for something I was filling out on a form and I was told they've got a new manager. Thus, I know why this jumped up two stars. It could have been four, but certain things they haven't fixed (rude cashier girl) have kept this review at a solid three.",alright go star actual less star review simpl seem better last work shop went night help boyfriend find interview outfit notic store hand employe back summer certain area cloth move around despit move switch around must done store seem realli clean order fact realli issu store except teeni tini littl problem check girl rememb work gave attitud need ask someth turn rude person particular night two check girl line peopl boyfriend make seper purchas knew us go get happen get friendli paid watch rude girl crack even half heart attempt smile listen rude explain elderli ladi certain mark sale normal price want make sure pay much littl explan one store longer make sens us line watch kept get huffi drop issu shove peopl bag practic threw said without tri fake kind custom servic good night bye next yuck cashier slightli frienldi still awesom obviou long night afteral stuck regist ice queen understand also catch name girl work dress room realli sweet kept greet everyon came call locat get name manag someth fill form told got new manag thu know jump two star could four certain thing fix rude cashier girl kept review solid three,0

"This review is for the chain in general. The location we went to is new so it isn't in Yelp yet. Once it is I will put this review there as well. We were there on Friday at 5 PM. 

The reason I gave it 2 stars is because the burger was very good and it was made the way I asked for it. My husbands burger was not.

But, the server and the fries left a lot to be desired. Let me preface by saying that we had been to several other locations. I like my fries crispy. I ask for them well done, extra crispy, scorched, tortured hollow tubes. Whatever their buzz word is for well done. The location will comply. EVERY OTHER 5 GUYS HAS COMPLIED. But not the one at TATUM AND SHEA. She said that corporate said they are not to cook the fries that way. So if we were to put up with soggy fries - yes soggy, then we did not want them. 

She also interrupted us several times which is rude. THEN she went and called corporate just to double check for us and she came to the table and said they said no they were not to cook them that way. Seriously? We did not ask for her to do this. She actually accused us of being undercover shoppers. We started to say something and then again- she interupted.

Listen, if you explain that our choice is not how the company wishes to present their product and we still choose to have them a different way, you should comply. It is after all our money and our decision. I was raised with the rules that #1 the customer is always right. And #2 if the customer is wrong REFER TO RULE NUMBER 1!!

We will not return. They have lost our business and I hope she loses her job.

We had been to DBG once before for Luminarias, but it was so dark that we couldn't see much. I'm glad we returned in the daylight.

We took my inlaws yesterday after brunch and they absolutely loved DBG. My father-in-law is totally into photography, so DBG was awesome for him. We saw tons of people with cameras, so it is a photographer's haven.  I really had no clue there were so many types of cactus. There are hands on activities scattered throughout (probably for kids on field trips) and boards with information, which comes in handy on the Sonoran Desert Trail when you want to figure out which mountain in the distance is Camelback, Piestewa, Four Peaks, etc.  We saw little lizards, hummingbirds, quail, and ground squirrels while wondering around as well.

There is much to see and you can get through the gardens as quickly or as leisurely as you would like. We spent about two and a half hours there, which I think is a perfect amount of time. You see everything and are ready to leave by the end.

Price was reasonable.  Waiting area was comfortable and well-decorated.  Food was inedible.   I got the lunch special, which include soup, egg roll, entree and fortune cookie.  I couldn't eat any of it.  The soup (hot and sour) was way too sour.  I felt like I would get acid reflux if I ate it.  I couldn't order the fried rice, because it contains peas (I've learned to ask...childhood trauma).  The rice was clotted together and difficult to eat.  The kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meat...so much so that I questioned whether it was actually chicken.  I watch too many movies.  The egg roll was just gross.

"Quiessence is, simply put, beautiful.  Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.

My friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.

For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.

The entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.

If the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.

"I had every intention of giving this place a chance.  Mostly because it doesn't look like the kind of place that people RAVE about after a meal.  Sometimes making a snap judgment is completely justified!

We were intially given a server that was not at all confident in her ability to perform her job even at the most basic of levels.  When she was asked about the ""specials"", she shrugged her shoulders and told us she didn't know about the ingredients or sides that were available.  I was still hanging in there and giving this place my all.  Afterall... she could have been new, having a terrible day OR goodness knows what she was going through that day?  Then the baby started screaming in the booth next to us and every server in the place ran for the hills, leaving the issue unaddressed.  PEOPLE!... if you have a crying baby, FOR THE LOVE... take the poor little thing outside and deal with the problem, don't force unsuspecting strangers to listen to it.  We opted for a changed of scenery within the restaurant after five minutes of non-stop crying and were moved into the main area of the restaurant and reassigned to a new server.

She no sooner finished warming my coffee (I use this term loosely, as it was more like colored water) before I glanced into the grill area which open for the whole restaurant to see.  This was the nightmare... I saw a rather large female cook with a tissue paper plug in her nose.  Anyone who's ever had a bloody nose knows that this is one of the few things you can do to passify the DRIPPING BLOOD!!  You would think a bloody nose would qualify one for a break until the bleeding subsided, wouldn't you??

"If we were able to give 0 stars... I would ask to give -1.

I live nearby, and am sad to see that a coffeeshop that sells coffee this horrible is still in business in my neighborhood.

Not only was the breve mocha that I ordered disgusting, so was the process of watching the barista make my drink.

They use hershey's chocolate from a dirty nacho cheese style pump with chocolate sauce dripping down the sides, and coagulated into a thick cap at the tip of the nozzle.  *Disgusting.  

The espresso shot was made without care, or concern for the fact that it was done way too quickly, and with espresso grounds that were ground way before I walked in the door.  Possibly way before the barista started her shift.   *Gross

And finally.  The milk.  She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand.  This was a huge red flag.  Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.  Well, both were accomplished. 

The steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.  And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use. 
Which is FREAKIN - DISGUSTING.

I wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha, and threw it away after taking a sip.  

Hundreds of businesses in the area close down every year, and there are more realty signs in strip malls in this neighborhood than actual storefronts.  AND I really don't understand why this place hasn't joined the many defunct businesses and starry eyed entrepreneurs in the unemployment line.  

If you own a coffeeshop.  Coffee should be your passion.  
If you own a bait shop.  Fishing should be your passion.
If you just want to open up a business that mirrors a nearby popular chain (short, tall, grande), please stop wasting space in the strip mall and get a day job in a cubicle.

"We chose this place for breakfast this morning because of the wonderful reviews on yelp.  I was certain it was going to be one of my new favorite places. 

We entered into a brightly painted orange restaurant and stood at the hostess stand for a few minutes waiting for the hostess to finish flirting with the server and notice us.  She clearly didn't want to be there and could care less where we sat, so opted for the table in the window.  

We sat and waited and waited and waited.  Tables that were sat after us already had their drinks and they were not busy.  Finally I tried to get the attention of the hostess who was standing half asleep at the hostess stand, mouth open wide, eyes half closed.  A few minutes later we finally had a server.

Our server was not very friendly.  I don't even think she said good morning.  We ordered.  Tables sat after us already got their food and we finally got our drinks.  She bought out 2 cups of coffee, but I did not order coffee so I made her take that back. 

Our food finally arrived.  We ordered french toast which came with strawberries, bananas and a cinnamon sauce, eggs benedict with crab cakes and two orders of country potatoes. 

Breakfast was pretty good.  I enjoyed my crab cake and the cinnamon sauce on the french toast was a nice added touch.  The potatoes were not good, they had WAY too much pepper on them, I couldn't even eat them.  Gary ate a few of his after he drowned them in ketchup.

We never saw our server again.  We got a water refilled after we finished our meal.  AND THE WAIT BEGAN.  We waited and waited and waited for our check.  Tables that were sat when we finished eating had already finished their food.  We never saw our waitress. I guess we were her only table, if not I felt bad for her other tables as well. 

Finally some guy brought us our check and tried to drop it off and run, I said WAIT and gave him my card and said, ""If I don't give this to you now it may be 20 more minutes before we see someone again""

Because I didn't look at the bill first when he brought it back I didn't notice until after I paid that they charged me $12.05 for the eggs benedict when their menu actually said $10.50.  I didn't say anything...  I just left a sad tip.

We were there for OVER an hour, they had lots of empty tables, and we only saw our server once.

Gary and I always over tip, because he and his family owned restaurants in the Valley for 35 years.  He has spent a lot of time being a chef and serving tables.  We know that when food comes out wrong, it's probably not the servers fault, and things happen, so we still tip well.  TODAY, I felt like we were invisible and I have no idea where our server disappeared to for the hour.

"I had a hard time even giving this place the third star.  I had high hopes as I watched this place go through renovations during the past 3 years.  We were there on opening night and fell in love with the decor.  The place was stylish and cool.  Concrete, leather, glass...very retro-modern.  The people who refurbished and redesigned this place deserve five stars.

The people who work there, however, deserve one.  

On opening night, I forgave the delay in service.  I forgave the nasty arugula on my panino.  I forgave the store-bought peperoni.  Mostly, I forgave them because the onion straws were so good.

We went back a few nights later after being fleeced for $40 in return for table scraps at Sens.  It took almost twenty minutes to order two pizzas and onion straws.  Then, the pizzas came out before the onion straws.  How do you cook pizza faster than deep frying an onion?  The waiter lingered around the female members of our party and were just incompetent.  

We finally went again after a night of drinking at the Clarendon.  What a buzz kill.  Not only was it too dark and the music was too loud but, again, the service was slow and dull.  Then, the waitress got into an argument about the ingredients of the pizza with our group.  Big no-no.

I've had multiple people tell me that service is fine as long as you order from the bar.  They say, just get up and go tell the bar tender what you want.  Why should I have to do all of the work?  How is it that they have ASU students at their disposal in a terrible economy and can't hire any decent waiters?

"Welcome to the funkiest place in Goodyear. If you've been craving sheet-metal winged pigs but regretting that Cave Creek is practically a day trip from the west valley, you may feel tempted to lie on the floor and weep tears of joy.

This Armadillo provides fine circuit training for working off breakfast at the Black Bear Diner, including a loft with moderately steep stairs. Like its cousin up toward Metro Center, it's an ""antique mall"" in the sense of focusing mostly on vintage items and less uncommon antiques, plus a smattering of ""collectibles."" This is the kind of antique mall I prefer, since it really functions as a sort of fantasy department store for shoppers who have a middle-of-the-road budget but whimsical or retro tastes.

Like the other Armadillo, stock here runs somewhat more to the frilly and ornate than to the mid-century modern, but it's not a total lock-out of swellness in favor of sweetness. Unlike the other one, there's a larger variety of dealers who aren't typical antique-mall fare: things like reproduction hardware, the aforementioned sheet-metal winged-pigs, repro tin signs, garden ornaments made from vintage dishes. This isn't my cuppa, but in context, it provides useful variety, and it fills booths (there are more empty booths here, but it's still fairly new).

A number of dealers seem to actually be replicated here, including the scrapbook store. Also replicated is the cheery professionalism of the operation: clean restrooms, occasional seating areas, efficient check-out, and available snacks. When you're hiking a layout this big, these things come to matter.",welcom funkiest place goodyear crave sheet metal wing pig regret cave creek practic day trip west valley may feel tempt lie floor weep tear joy armadillo provid fine circuit train work breakfast black bear diner includ loft moder steep stair like cousin toward metro center antiqu mall sens focus mostli vintag less uncommon antiqu plu smatter collect kind antiqu mall prefer sinc realli function sort fantasi depart store shopper middl road budget whimsic retro tast like armadillo stock run somewhat frilli ornat mid centuri modern total lock swell favor sweet unlik larger varieti dealer typic antiqu mall fare thing like reproduct hardwar aforement sheet metal wing pig repro tin sign garden ornament made vintag dish cuppa context provid use varieti fill booth empti booth still fairli new number dealer seem actual replic includ scrapbook store also replic cheeri profession oper clean restroom occasion seat area effici check avail snack hike layout big thing come matter,0

"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content.

"Yum yum yum. Husband and I first went there early on a First Friday night and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. We didn't want anything too heavy since we were planning on doing some walking so we split the Spanish cheese plate which was delightful. The fig cake is delicious!! Splitting the plate made the bill pretty affordable and it was just enough to fill us up without overdoing it.

The server was very helpful in suggesting a champagne for me and red wine for husband. Don't remember what we had but my champagne had a strawberry in it and was perfectly bubbly.

"Ahhh... Zinc.  It's been a while since I have left Paris.  Being a resident and citizen there for so long, I would like to think I can spot a decent French fare.  I have now been to Zinc three times, every time I ordered something different, so far the food has not dissapointed as much as the prices have.  Wow.

Okay, okay, you have a spot in Scottdale, it's a nice little posh area with plenty of traffic, designer furniture and nick-nack and artsy stores that typically have things that would require your to take out a 2nd mortgage to afford those things that often just gather dust, one season at a time at home.  You would think someone on that strip would be the one to say, let's have reasonable prices.  Zinc is not one of those.

The restaurant has the name Bistro in it. They have folks dining out on the sidewalk, dining with noise and the occasional smell of BMW exausts...  That's beautiful and very Parisian, also very Bistro.  Here is a wake up call though... Bistros offer fares with decent prices, a prix fixe menu and simply good simple food.  

The prices were incredibly high for what you do get.  Unfortunately the charm of having an outdoor patio and serving fries in fake newspaper doesn't cut it.    The Steak Frites (a hanger steak w/ fries and a brandy sauce) is a French Bistro Classic, a staple if you will and that was the only thing that was fairly prices for what you get.  But if you knew how much those cuts are to get from a supplier, you'd be asking questions about the prices even then.

On two of those occasions we had cheese plates, it was more of a mix and match, you could pick from a few Chevres, Softs and hard cheeses,  they were incredibly small portions but the breads that came with the platter was very tasty, warm and fresh.  It is typically served with a ramkin of olives.

So overall, sounds like I am bashing this restaurant, I am not but I am dieing to find a reason to go back because there is something good about it, the atmosphere, the lighting, the seasonal menu.  But little things keep me from enjoying Zinc.  Such as the time we sat at the secluded back part of the restaurant, the small courtyard.  Very charming, though some of the waiters, and cooks smoked right outside of the courtyard's gates.  The smell of cheap cigarettes and mumbled chatter caused us to ask for another table, when we did, we were all the sudden looked as ""picky customers"".

"I love everything at Market bistro, but I especially love the salads.  I always get the create your own with their homemade and delicious buttermilk Caesar dressing on the side.

"I love the White Tanks! 
It is one of the few parks in the valley that isn't completely surrounded by development, at the top are beautiful fields and you notice the fauna change. There is also water in huge white stone natural catchment areas, hence the name ""White Tanks"" 
However, recently there is a library being developed at the edge of this park, far from many homes and just plain uninspiring to think that everyone who goes there has to drive a good few miles just to read a book
Here are my thoughts on the matter that I wrote in this article about the new ""Green"" library in AZcentral
http://www.azcentral.com/community/westvalley/articles/2010/04/21/20100421-white-tank-mountain-regional-park-library.html

""I could not believe when I pulled up to the White Tanks to take a coveted hike through the beautiful hills, that the removal of huge cacti and the building of yet another public monstrosity was taking place. First of all how can anyone call this green? Can't we just leave one place in the valley free from so many cars, asphalt and brick? How is anyone supposed to get out there anyway? It is so far from most home development and completly in the wrong direction to support any kind of ""Green"" living and combining activities as most people do when they visit a public institution such as finding a place to eat lunch, a store to check out, or to mail a letter. Putting a library out away far from urban development and removing tons of cacti to transplant somewhere else is a crime against nature!

"A dark night in a city that knows how to keep its secrets. But on the 12th floor of the Acme building, one man is trying to find the answers to life's persistent questions: Guy Noir, Private Eye. (THEME) 

It was a night in November. November 23rd in fact. I remember the date because it was my birthday. The snow birds that had started to flock from their summer homes had long since retired for the evening and the godfearing people of Phoenix had closed shop. My two lovely companions and I were looking for a place to fill our bellies. Like moths to a flame we were attracted to a dim light coming from a dark parking lot. We exited the car.

""Are you going to Mama Mia's?""

A beautiful petite girl with the kind of body men write home about stepped out of the shadows. I was going wherever she took me.

We were led through the kind of kitchen you only see in mob movies. I wasn't going to ask what they put in the sausage.

We stepped in and figured out our toppings. Trying to figure out toppings for one pizza between three people you may as well be figuring out cold fusion with a box of toothpicks and some masking tape. But with the plethora of options I felt like I had a bag of bananas in a monkey whore house and we narrowed it to basil and fresh tomato.

The pizza was exactly what a tired and famished private eye like myself needed on a night like this.

Man working  register- ""Is that a wig?""

Jetta-"" Yeah its a wig.""

We left the pizza joint as happy as a twister in a trailer park.

Jetta- ""I am so getting a weave.""

"Having just returned from a whirlwind overseas business trip, Condor had to unwind. No place better than the Spa at Camelback Inn. It has been years since Condor visited and, as I expected, they did not recall that on my last visit I mistakenly thought the terrycloth robe and slippers were a gift.  The letters demanding their return stopped after 3 months.

Arriving in the lobby I was greeted by the soothing sound of Asian Zen music and the tranquil flow of fountain water. After a quick flashback to the three days in a jungle hut cell due to a jade sale gone bad, I headed to the luxurious locker, donned the fluffy terrycloth robe and settled poolside. 

My first disappointment of not having a drink in hand almost immediately was soothed when staff opened the bar 2 hours early. Talk about customer service at 7:30 in the morning. Having the secluded pool to myself, literally, I settled in to a literary vacation of the mind. It had been a long time since I read ""US Weekly"". 

Engrossed in the torrid life experiences of the hoi polli, I hardly noticed Companion had arrived and asked why I had already consumed six umbrella laden cocktails. ""The heat,"" I responded. ""It's 75 degrees,"" Companion stated with the accuracy of a former weekend weather girl in San Diego. 

Well, more cocktails ensued, including Companion's Mango Margarita, whose orange color I compared to the stunning, skin tight dress worn by an unknown actress named ""Roxie"" at a Red Carpet Event in the pages of ""US Weekly"". The color of the Mango Margarita complimented  the snow white of my robe after it was hurled in my direction. 

Another drink soothed Companion's ire and it was time for the highlight of the day: our individual Swedish Massages! Escorted by my Massage Therapist, the spitting image of Peta Wilson (Google it.) I was soon transported into a realm of relaxation and bliss. The bad news came when I was awaken from my trance by a knock on the door. It seems my snoring had disturbed the guests next door and my session was cut short. 

No matter, more poolside time with Companion awaited and more frothy cocktails. Unfortunately, upon return to my chaise lounge, I was greeted with a note. Apparently Companion and her Male Masseur hit it off and were enjoying cocktails at the Valley Ho Hotel down the street. I was definitely not invited. 

Well, upon reflection, the facility, service, therapist and massage were excellent. Although romance did not blossom, I did add another terrycloth robe to my closet, albeit with a Mango Margarita stain.",return whirlwind oversea busi trip condor unwind place better spa camelback inn year sinc condor visit expect recal last visit mistakenli thought terrycloth robe slipper gift letter demand return stop month arriv lobbi greet sooth sound asian zen music tranquil flow fountain water quick flashback three day jungl hut cell due jade sale gone head luxuri locker don fluffi terrycloth robe settl poolsid first disappoint drink hand almost immedi sooth staff open bar hour earli talk custom servic morn seclud pool liter settl literari vacat mind long sinc us weekli engross torrid life experi hoi polli hardli notic companion arriv ask alreadi consum six umbrella laden cocktail heat respond degre companion state accuraci former weekend weather girl san diego well cocktail ensu includ companion mango margarita whose orang color compar stun skin tight dress worn unknown actress name roxi red carpet event page us weekli color mango margarita compliment snow white robe hurl direct anoth drink sooth companion ire highlight day individu swedish massag escort massag therapist spit imag peta wilson googl soon transport realm relax bliss news came awaken tranc knock door seem snore disturb guest next door session cut short matter poolsid companion await frothi cocktail unfortun upon return chais loung greet note appar companion male masseur hit enjoy cocktail valley ho hotel street definit invit well upon reflect facil servic therapist massag excel although romanc blossom add anoth terrycloth robe closet albeit mango margarita stain,0

"Two times a year, you can meander down Mill Ave and the adjoining streets to look at an array of art for sale. Everything from jewelry and pop art posters to handmade kitchen utensils, photography and abstract paintings. 

If you go both in Spring and Winter, you're likely to see a few of the same artists. For the most part, Tempe Arts Festival does a great job of providing variety. Plus, it's fun to wander and look at things you may not have seen before - let alone expected to see at an arts festival. 

This isn't the most exciting of art festivals. There's really no live music, unless you count the occasional melodies of flutes you hear when you walk by the vendor selling his handmade wooden flutes. 

I've been three times and enjoyed myself every time. I wasn't wowed. I never saw anything I couldn't live without. But, like I said, this is a fun event to mark on your calender for both Spring and Winter - even if it happens to rain during the festival. 

I give last Winter's and this Spring's festivals both a 4-star review, for the weather and company were great. It was my first year going, and I was happy to see that Tempe offered the Valley something that appealed to people who really do try and appreciate art. After all, it's a ""consumer"" type of event, geared toward bringing the community and artists together. I can appreciate that. 

I give this Winter's festival a 3-star review. The rain didn't phase me. I can deal with a few sprinkles. What bothered me was the mixing of ASU and UofA fans, both groups beginning to gather down on Mill Ave for the football showdown. Don't get me wrong, I love a good sporting event and understand team rivalry. I just thought it was unfortunate that the upcoming game and the fans' excitement took over the relaxed, casual feel that the arts festival usually has - you know, when you can walk down the street and look at art without running into an impromptu cheer section. 

You see, fans were screaming in the streets - hollering insults to the other team - and waving their school's colors high. (Once again, I understand the fun of that. I just didn't expect it to be all over the streets in the early afternoon. Maybe I'm naive, though.) The fans were a definite distraction from the art festival. Knowing what would happen when alcohol was mixed into the equation, my friend and I decided to bolt. 

Lucky we did. Seems like Tempe can't handle a few rain droplets, for when we were walking back to the car, a street lamp post nearly fell on our heads. Talk about a commotion. 

I'd much rather attention be fixed on the art festival rather than any football game or falling lamp posts, no matter how dramatic both of those things can be.

I s'pose this echoes the old saying, ""There's a time and place for everything.""

Word to the wise: Parking can be hard to find, or require you to shell out $10 for a spot. If you can, park somewhere closeby that's free of charge and hoof it on foot.",two time year meander mill ave adjoin street look array art sale everyth jewelri pop art poster handmad kitchen utensil photographi abstract paint go spring winter like see artist part temp art festiv great job provid varieti plu fun wander look thing may seen let alon expect see art festiv excit art festiv realli live music unless count occasion melodi flute hear walk vendor sell handmad wooden flute three time enjoy everi wow never saw anyth live without like said fun event mark calend spring winter even happen rain festiv give last winter spring festiv star review weather compani great first year go happi see temp offer valley someth appeal peopl realli tri appreci art consum type event gear toward bring commun artist togeth appreci give winter festiv star review rain phase deal sprinkl bother mix asu uofa fan group begin gather mill ave footbal showdown get wrong love good sport event understand team rivalri thought unfortun upcom game fan excit took relax casual feel art festiv usual know walk street look art without run impromptu cheer section see fan scream street holler insult team wave school color high understand fun expect street earli afternoon mayb naiv though fan definit distract art festiv know would happen alcohol mix equat friend decid bolt lucki seem like temp handl rain droplet walk back car street lamp post nearli fell head talk commot much rather attent fix art festiv rather footbal game fall lamp post matter dramat thing pose echo old say place everyth word wise park hard find requir shell spot park somewher closebi free charg hoof foot,0
"I like to think of Trader Joe's as a ""specialty food/health market."" It is simply in a league of its own when compared to large commercial grocery chains. Honestly, there is no comparison! 

With that being said, this is the BEST Trader Joe's I have been too! (and I have shopped quite a few in my travels across the US) The sheer size of this store, in TJ standards, is IMPRESSIVE!  The isles are plenty large enough for TWO people (with carts) to maneuver through.  And more importantly EVERYTHING looks fresh and delectable!  

Some of my fav's are: 

$3.99 Trader Joe's Coastal Cab...FABULOUS for the price! (Quite honestly though, I haven't EVER had a bad wine at Traders...they have an amazing selection that isn't overwhelming but isn't sparse either.) I also LOVE that they CLEARLY label each of the wines and/or regions so they are quick and easy to find! 

The Haircot Verts (French Green Beans) are simply delicious! Their Brussel Sprouts are the perfect size and quantity; just enough for two people at two different meals.  They even have Nulaid ""Ready Egg"" (i.e. egg beaters) for $3.69! At the grocery store the SAME stuff will cost you TWICE that!! 

Their cheese selection is delightful with almost ANY kind of cheese imaginable! Their artesian breads are so yummy...although not a ""low fat/fat free"" food, so that is a once every few months splurge. (and even then we only get the small loaf (which I want to say is called a ""little bastard."" That name CRACKS me up!) 

And although I am not a ""sweet"" eater, my hubs is...so he has a dozen or so goodies that he constantly gets here. The one I can think of off the top of my head are their Chocolate Covered Joe Joe's with Peppermint Crumble (or something like that.) I'd go look at the box but we are fresh out because the hubs thinks that eating one box over a two-three day period is acceptable! 

It also fun to be rewarded for bringing your own reusable bags; as any good eco-friendly shopper would do! There is a weekly drawing for a TJ's gift card (I think the value is $25) and you get a ticket when you bring your own bags. (not one for each bag...just one ticket for bringing them to put your goodies in) Then they draw a name out of all the tickets (which you drop in a box on your way out of the store) once a week.  

If you shop more than once a week, you can ""earn"" a ticket for each time you shop there in a week therefore increasing your chances of winning. (although I am PRETTY sure the majority of Surprise/Sun City Grand shop there so maybe the odds aren't THAT great! )

Regardless, this is just a great little ""market"" through and through. I used to get excited to shop at TJ's...now I am always looking for an excuse to buy something just so I can go there!

I ordered an iced tea and before it took her over ten minutes to come back so I could get some pink packets to sweeten it up.  (And that tea was dark!)

After that little slip, everything was perfect...(though my miso soup didn't have any seaweed in it...which is odd in my book)  I had the Spicy Scallop and the Philly Roll...both were awesome!  And my friend's California Roll with Asparagus was the best.  I will have to order that next time for sure.

The sushi chef was very nice and the other server there was more attentive.  I loved the menu and it had a lot to offer.  (And since I am don't know a lot of my sushi yet, I liked it that they had descriptions)  The place was clean and I really liked the layout.  I will have to go there again and have some sake as well. :)",begin hook sushi two year ago would told sushi wrong wrong went sushi eye friday wonder love friend know excit go especi rave review first littl put sinc thought server littl bit moron splash attitud order ice tea took ten minut come back could get pink packet sweeten tea dark littl slip everyth perfect though miso soup seawe odd book spici scallop philli roll awesom friend california roll asparagu best order next sure sushi chef nice server attent love menu lot offer sinc know lot sushi yet like descript place clean realli like layout go sake well,0

"Meh. As my fellow Yelper said to me a few days after we ate here: ""No Brio review, I'm shocked!"" 

I didn't jump on writing this review because I was pretty underwhelmed by the experience. The ambience sucks, the service wasn't very good and the food was totally average. 

My cursor is blinking at me and I still don't know what else to say about my time spent here. 

Ambience- looks like an Italian cheesecake factory. Why are the collumns so huge?!

Service- the bartender kept interrupting us to take our order when we STILL weren't ready. Jeez, does it look like I've moved my menu in the 53 seconds it's been since the last time you checked? And then disappeared when we were finally ready. 

Food- 
-carpaccio, not bad but does it seriously need to be that huge? The two of us didn't even come close to finishing it. 
-Mediterranean pasta, pretty much the only one without a cream sauce on the whole menu. They split it for us which was nice and it tasted all right with mushrooms and chicken and stuff. 
-tiramisu came out frozen. They were super apologetic and didn't charge us for the replacement, but it was still awkward. They obviously just heated up a piece which made it melty and just not that great.

"I am furious.

In the last 12 months, I have had at least scheduling issues, from them calling me at 8AM on a Saturday morning (my 1 day off) to cancel my 11am appointment to last Saturday, when I went in only to be told someone had messed up, and actually booked me for the NEXT week, and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am, they couldn't get me in until maybe that evening, and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissue/medical massage. I was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then, but Ashley the clinic manager promised me that they'd give me my next week appointment free of charge, and that she'd personally be certain there were no more issues.  As I literally couldn't turn my head to the left due to pain, I took her up on that. BIG MISTAKE.

Yesterday (the Friday before my ""correctly"" scheduled massage, I went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment, to try and avoid last week's debacle. According to the woman who answered the phone, it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off, but she went to talk with her manager, and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok, and that she'd call with any issues. Then yesterday evening, I got ANOTHER confirmation call from Massage Envy, confirming and reminding me of my 11:30am appt on Saturday with my preferred therapist. GIven that I've had 3 migraines this week (versus my 0 or 1 when I get a massage the weekend prior), I really absolutely needed to get in, so I felt more confident.

Well, I was just woken up at 8am...again. On my day off...again. To explain to me that, big shock, they messed up my scheduling again, and that apparently, my therapist was off today. Despite Ashley's promise of it not happening again. Despite me being pro-active and calling to confirm. I am sitting here in pain, so furious at this repeated treatment that I can't even go back to bed...and the best part? They don't even have a manager on duty I can complain to.

My treatment at the hands of the booking/front desk staff has been any thing BUT relaxing. I continue to walk out of there frustrated, angry, and occasionally in tears. I know they say Fool Me Once, Shame On You, Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me, but I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm pretty screwed for today and the next week, but luckily, an Elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area. At this point, it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy. As much as I love Talisha and Aisha as massage therapists, getting a massage should feel good, and not like you're just a number to them, not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend IN the appointment.",furiou last month least schedul issu call saturday morn day cancel appoint last saturday went told someon mess actual book next week despit drive way get mayb even someon experi deep tissu medic massag irrit readi ask membership refund ashley clinic manag promis give next week appoint free charg person certain issu liter turn head left due pain took big mistak yesterday friday correctli schedul massag went way call confirm bloodi appoint tri avoid last week debacl accord woman answer phone look like schedul therapist actual schedul went talk manag came back phone tell everyth ok call issu yesterday even got anoth confirm call massag envi confirm remind appt saturday prefer therapist given migrain week versu get massag weekend prior realli absolut need get felt confid well woken day explain big shock mess schedul appar therapist today despit ashley promis happen despit pro activ call confirm sit pain furiou repeat treatment even go back bed best part even manag duti complain treatment hand book front desk staff relax continu walk frustrat angri occasion tear know say fool shame fool twice shame tri give benefit doubt pretti screw today next week luckili element place similar concept open recent gener area point liter cannot wors massag envi much love talisha aisha massag therapist get massag feel good like number like actual spend tri get damn appoint actual get spend appoint,1
"Was extremely psyched to try Lobby's, considering all of the great reviews, but I was sadly disappointed with the results. I'm a freak for Chili burgers (good ones are very difficult to find) and The Lobby's Chili burger was fairly dull, featured Cinci style Chili (BLAH) and like. some sort of cheese whiz kinda crap.  Boo. Also ordered fries, and a Chicago dog.. the Chicago dog was overpriced and forgettable, and the crinkle cut fries were reminiscent of Del Taco's.. which isn't exactly a bad thing, but considering that Lobby's is supposed to be a tasty, quality burger place, frozen crinkle fries are kind of a half assed approach.. ALSO the amount of salt on the fries was enough to invoke a stroke! :x  Finally whoever dude was that handed me my bag of food was all like ZIPPY DOO I GAVE YOU A CUP OF FRENCH FRY SAUCE..

"We were exceptionally sun deprived by the time March came around, so that may have swayed my review to be exceptionally sunny.  I was pleasantly surprised by the FLW inspired architecture (I didn't do any research on the hotel-my husband picked it) and by the beautiful grounds. Our room was very comfortable but we spent the majority of our time at the pool or on the  patio relaxing.  It is definitely not 5 star service across the board, but no one was rude. Our room wasn't cleaned the entire 3 days we were there, even after we asked the front desk to send housekeeping. That didn't get us down--after all, we didn't come there to hang out in our room.

"The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job.

"Even though I am officially in my 30s, I look like I'm still in college, which made me feel slightly less uncomfortable when I walked into The Clubhouse. Yes, it is near ASU, and yes, it is an all-age venue, so I should have expected that the club would be filled with 18-20 somethings. But just because I look 21, doesn't mean that my internal reality made me feel a little out-of-place. But, I was like, whateva!

It is somewhat of a dive bar trying to be a club but failing miserably. Like a nerd trying to be punk or a cheerleader trying to be emo -- it somehow didn't work for me. It felt like I was in someone's basement turned rocker's haven. Black walls, haphazard decor, and one sole stinky quasi-couch that looked like it had been salvaged from some dump. 

The stage was at the front of the club, and the bar in the middle dissected the under-21 crowd from the over-21 boozers. Unfortunately, if you wanted to drink, you had to stay on the over-21 side of the bar. That sucked because you barely had a view of the stage. WTF?!  Shouldn't the paying lushes get a better view than the youngsters who only paid to get in the club? Stupid. I have to say, though, the sound system was a helluva lot better than some of the other small music venues I've been to.  That's a plus.  

Finally, this last annoyance will definitely show my age, but having to stand the entire time I was there was horrible. My feet hurt, dammit! And, I just wanted to sit down!

"I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating.

They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line. 

Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.

Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.

I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit.

We didn't get lucky enough to have a butterfly land on us, but we did see tons of gorgeous butterflies.  There were orange butterflies and yellow butterflies and striped butterflies, etc... The flowers in the pavillion are pretty to look at as well.  We visited the gift kiosk afterward and took home a butterfly finger puppet, which I know we will get tons of use from (only $6.25). The exhibit runs until May 13th, so don't miss it!

"Unless you are a regular or look like your wallet is fat don't expect the best service.  Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection. 

I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .  

My meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.  

Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.  

Just a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.  We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something.  Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part.

They have an excellent beer and wine selection. As a matter of fact, their beer selection is one of the best I've seen in AZ. Tons of micro-beers and many different and unique bottles of rare Euro- brau. For the selection, to stop by and pick something up and go, this place is great. As a restaurant/Wine Bar bar, I give this place a big...Meh.

The service was terrible. Of the party of 6, everyone that ordered a glass of wine, only got one. They sat with their glasses empty for at least 30 minutes. Those of us drinking beer, just walked over to cooler and grabbed a beer. We also had an appetizer. We got the warm pretzels with gourmet mustard. It was frozen pretzels they microwaved with Honey mustard. They were still cool in the middle and a little stale.

Up until about 6 months ago I would have given this place 4, possibly 5 stars, but with the horrible service I have encountered the last 6 months I'm only giving it 2. Normally I order my food to go at the bar and just take it home and eat it. But the for the last 6 months when I go in to order my food at the bar, its always the same bar tender working and she is rude. The last 3 times I have been into order food I ended up just walking out and not ordering anything. She is always taking to what seems to be her friends at the bar. I always know what I want right when I go in, so there is no need for a menu, she greets me and hands me a menu totally ignoring me telling her that I already knew what I wanted. Then she precedes to talk to her ""friend"" or whoever at the bar for 15 minutes before taking my order. I know all of her personal business and even what she plans on wearing to her friends wedding in a few weeks. The food is good, but considering there are so many other really great sushi places with so much better customer services i would not recommend this place at all.

"I first saw them Saturday morning at the Phoenix Public Market and told myself that I would have to try them soon. I was too full from all the sampling with the different vendors. My coworkers and I went to check out the food trucks that gather on Thursday outside of Whole Foods by Raintree and the 101. I saw that Mojo Bowl was there and made my mind up right away to get their food.

I decided to get the Red, White, and Kale salad. I love quinoa and kale so it was the obvious choice for me. I also wanted to try one of their smoothies out. I went with the Coco Coca. The description mentioned that it was like a drinkable Almond Joy and I was sold right there. The total came to $13, not too shabby considering the portions. I didn't even touch my salad because the smoothie was so fulling, definitely a meal in itself. Towards the end of the work day I was getting hungry and decided to try some of the salad. I was asked if I wanted a balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette to go with the salad. I told the guy whatever tastes better and he told me that would be the raspberry vinaigrette. The salad was delicious. The kale was chopped up so finely that it really didn't have a taste so if you're not a huge fan of kale you might still like the salad. The portion was huge, it was good for 2 meals.

"Foothills Park in North Glendale, AZ is a more than just a dog park!!!  This park has a skate park, an aquatic center / fitness center, baseball/softball fields and a branch of the Glendale Public Library.

On the north side of the park is the Foothills branch of the Glendale Public Library. Here in 2011 this branch has started closing earlier a couple days a week and they are now closed on Thursdays and Sundays. You can still request books online to be transferred to this branch for your convenience.

The dog park was recently expanded with a new section of dog run that connects the front of the park on 57th Ave with the back of the park behind the library.  Parts of the dog park are closed a day a week for maintenance, but part of the park is open every day.

The baseball fields are the area of the park I use the most. Arrowhead Little League (www.ArrowheadLL.com) is based at this park and they play two seasons - Spring and Fall. The City of Glendale also runs baseball and softball programs at this park.  

A playground sits on the South side of the baseball fields, just North of the wash.

The Aquatic Center (www.glendaleaz.com/foothillscenter/) has an outdoor pool with slides and lap pools.  There's a fitness center indoors with all the equipment of a normal gym plus a rock climbing wall and full indoor basketball court.  The kids love to hang out at the rec center.

"We had a very difficult time finding trail 201 which was noted as one of the more strenuous hikes. We took trail 100 and came across some extreme mountain bikers, several other hikers and a couple who gave us confusing directions on how to reach one of the highest sections of the mountain. We got lost and ended trail busting which is highly discouraged but give us rules and we will break  em. During our run back down the trail I took a pretty hard fall face planting into the dirt, stabbing my right hand into a rock and banging up my knee. No broken bones or teeth, thankfully. We had just passed a couple of hikers when I took the fall so they saw everything. I laid there for about 10 seconds, jumped back up, noticed the blood, my torn tee and just continued on with the hike. We came across a park ranger who was standing outside his truck and asked if he had any medical supplies. Unfortunately, his first aid kit was about 20 years old and didn't contain anything that would help any of my wounds. We found a CVS on our way home and picked up some medical supplies and my wounds were washed and bandaged in the parking lot. 

Probably my most memorable hike thus far.",difficult find trail note strenuou hike took trail came across extrem mountain biker sever hiker coupl gave us confus direct reach highest section mountain got lost end trail bust highli discourag give us rule break em run back trail took pretti hard fall face plant dirt stab right hand rock bang knee broken bone teeth thank pass coupl hiker took fall saw everyth laid second jump back notic blood torn tee continu hike came across park ranger stand outsid truck ask medic suppli unfortun first aid kit year old contain anyth would help wound found cv way home pick medic suppli wound wash bandag park lot probabl memor hike thu far,0

"Heed the negative reviews.

This restaurant can be summed up in two words: mediocre & overpriced. I wish I had gone with my instinct and given more weight to the negative reviews. The positive reviews of the spring rolls lured me in, however, much to my disappointment. One spring roll is $4.50, although we fortunately went for the happy hour and only paid $3.50, which was still too much, in my opinion. They were stuffed mostly with lettuce and had little to no flavor., and we tried 3 different kinds. The peanut sauce was overly thick and cloyingly sweet and added nothing positive to the rolls.

I had the Lemon Grass Chicken for dinner. The chicken was overcooked and dry and absolutely flavorless and the noodles were overly sweet. I couldn't detect even a hint of the lemon grass. The presentation was unappetizing, with the overcooked chicken just slapped on to the side of the noodles.

I'm not going to speak for my companions as they were there at my invitation and probably didn't want to be negative, but neither of them made any positive comments about their food. 

As I said, pay attention to the negative reviews. If you like bland, overpriced food, you may like this place, but otherwise I can't see anyone going back for more.",heed neg review restaur sum two word mediocr overpr wish gone instinct given weight neg review posit review spring roll lure howev much disappoint spring roll although fortun went happi hour paid still much opinion stuf mostli lettuc littl flavor tri differ kind peanut sauc overli thick cloyingli sweet ad noth posit roll lemon grass chicken dinner chicken overcook dri absolut flavorless noodl overli sweet detect even hint lemon grass present unappet overcook chicken slap side noodl go speak companion invit probabl want neg neither made posit comment food said pay attent neg review like bland overpr food may like place otherwis see anyon go back,0

"Huge fan of Bikram yoga! It's a 90 minute, torturous-at-times, sweat-filled  workout but when you are done, you feel insanely amazing. The feeling continues throughout the day leaving you in complete zen....Road rage? Gone. Annoying food cravings? Zero. Jeans? Fitting awesome. You really must try it, it can completely change your body.

There are a few places in the valley that offer Bikram, most of them exclusively rather than in combo with other methods of yoga. The Bikram Institute on Miller and Indian School is where I first tried it, and I like it the best so far. They offer classes throughout the day and later in the evening as well. Like other studios, this place offers first timers a week-long pass for around $20. What I really like about this studio is their instructors and the fact that they keep their room darkened throughout the entire practice. I've have been going to another studio lately (for their first-time student deals) and their instructors bark out instructions non-stop plus they keep the lights on the whole time. So when you're staring up lying in your relaxed state, your eyes meet the glare of the fluorescent.

"Spa whore, I am! I work in the industry, live in the industry and have breathed the industry for the last 5 years so I know spas. After a few stressful weeks of work, school and planning a wedding I suddenly remembered I am a better version of myself when I take adult time outs. My ""corner"", so to speak, was at Joya spa. I just so happen to remember a TravelZoo purchase I made a few months ago for a massage or facial at Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort in Phoenix.
Boy, was I excited! I called, booked an appointment with a male therapist and started to prepare myself for my next great spa adventure. 
After anxiously awaiting  Sunday to roll around, I finally found myself walking into a Moroccan paradise. The space was entrancing from the moment I walked in. It smelled like a spa and helped to set the mood for my day of relaxation. I was given a full tour of the facilities and allowed to set my intentions with small crystals in a round room, and then brought into a room with a GIANT crystal used to help calm, bring intention and awareness of your visit and to yourself. The woman giving me the tour was very professional and thorough. Though informative, I was waiting for a warm connection from her, and never received it.
After being led to the locker room, I changed into my bathing suit and waited in the woman's lounge for my provider to find me and take me back for my massage experience.
I chose a male provider. Knowing I had tension, knots and stress I was hoping for a firm, slow, relaxing massage. I have had MANY massages and this one was actually a little disappointing. My therapist picked me 7 minutes late and ended 5 minutes early. The strokes consisted of a lot of rocking and fast movements. Not really the relaxing experience I was craving. My massage therapist was very sweet and genuine in his approach, I was just hoping for something more.
I definitely didn't let my treatment ruin my experience! The facilities were amazing!  They were clean and always stocked with towels. I have to say the spa attendants ROCKED!!!!! I could not believe how efficient they were. I observed on 5 occasions (YES 5) every time a shower was vacant an attendant was there to clean it up, any time a towel was on the floor, it got picked up immediately. They worked together like a well oiled machine! And I would love to give them props for making me take notice to the work the do!
I plan on returning! I may not receive a massage because of my experience, but I truly enjoyed the facilities and the staff. I'm even thinking of booking a suite for my bridal party to enjoy the day there. In the end, if you know massage the way I do, please beware, you may not get all the bang for your buck in your treatment.",spa whore work industri live industri breath industri last year know spa stress week work school plan wed suddenli rememb better version take adult out corner speak joya spa happen rememb travelzoo purchas made month ago massag facial joya spa montelucia resort phoenix boy excit call book appoint male therapist start prepar next great spa adventur anxious await sunday roll around final found walk moroccan paradis space entranc moment walk smell like spa help set mood day relax given full tour facil allow set intent small crystal round room brought room giant crystal use help calm bring intent awar visit woman give tour profession thorough though inform wait warm connect never receiv led locker room chang bath suit wait woman loung provid find take back massag experi chose male provid know tension knot stress hope firm slow relax massag mani massag actual littl disappoint therapist pick minut late end minut earli stroke consist lot rock fast movement realli relax experi crave massag therapist sweet genuin approach hope someth definit let treatment ruin experi facil amaz clean alway stock towel say spa attend rock could believ effici observ occas ye everi shower vacant attend clean towel floor got pick immedi work togeth like well oil machin would love give prop make take notic work plan return may receiv massag experi truli enjoy facil staff even think book suit bridal parti enjoy day end know massag way pleas bewar may get bang buck treatment,0

"Referring  to Mickey's as a  ""dive bar"" is like referring to Princeton as a ""secondary school"".  Its a lazily, flaccid description for a bar with a fist-full of moxie.  Their Bloody Marys alone feature a fucking brawny-assed, gigantic totem pole of man-meat.  Well, not ""man meat"", but meat-fit-for-a-man.  You get the point.  

Look, the main point is that no ""dive bar"" is gonna be serving yo ass peppers and salami in a $5 tomato Slurpee.  

People often mistake ""kitsch"" as ""obsolete""  and these these are the type of people who would use the word ""psych!"", and grease their side-hair back after swindling you into a fake low-five.  

And i would like to agree with their lowly opinions of Mickey's, but then, I wouldn't want to be wrong also.

If you've ever been to Welcome to the Johnson's in the Lower East Side, and moreover, enjoyed yourself there, then Mickey's is your Arizona equivalent.  Think of it as, Welcome to the Merriweather's.  Scottsdale name, New York kitsch.  

So, their bar service is kinda tough, but once there, they have a kickass selection of brews both ironic and sincere.  You want an Old Style followed by a Boddington's?  Where else but Mickey's?

Their kitchen is open late, which, for the love of all that is holy, is impossible to find in this three-bedroom-two-bath-house of a town.

Even better, their food is goooood.  I mean, heart palpitating good when you consider how delish bar food REALLY CAN be at 2 am.  No, it ain't Capital Grille, get over it, but their wings, fries, chix tenders, et all hit the f'ing spot when you've had too many Jamisons (or Jager/Patron shots for the resident middle schoolers).

They just recently seemed to have remodeled their patio, which looks really great, but lost most of its charm.  Still, space to move and a decent spot to smoke outside beats a macrame couch, or whatever, every day of the week.

"It serves the purpose.  That's about it.

Raging Waters it is not. A smaller water park attached to a mini golf course it is.

Slides are fun. Night splash is great--no sun, bearable temperatures and no sun burn. I definitely would never go during the day. I couldn't imagine standing in line for 1 hour+ with no shade, 110+ temps and broken misters (I didn't see a functioning mister in the entire park). 

Park could use a bit maintenance. Staff could use a bit of training.  Lines were very disorganized. Staff didn't have much of a clue as to what was going on. Ex:  spent our last 45 minutes waiting for the wave pool, getting into the wave pool and waiting about 15-20 minutes only for the wave pool to never come on and for the park to close.  Losing almost a full hour out of the 4 that night splash is open was a bit disappointing.

"Considering what is considered the 'norm' for workout facilities... this place is WAY behind the times.

This place would be amazing for 1952- it would then be considered clean, tidy, and cutting edge. There are some actual perks about this place- they do have daycare and plenty of mirrors for me to watch my fat jiggle while I run on the treadmill ;)

It's just an utter disaster. When the BF and I originally signed up, we got a couples membership at a newly redone Glendale location and it was worth the monthly membership fee.

This place does not need a 'face-lift.' It needs to be gutted and TOTALLY renovated.

"Tried the Restaurant Week special, and chose the Stetson chopped salad, mixed mushrooms with polenta, and bread pudding.  The Stetson chopped was amazing.  The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out, and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet, savory, crunchy, soft once the salad is mixed up.  I tried some of the testosterone salad, which was decent, and filled with a lot of well prepared beef, but it didn't quite compare to the chopped salad.  

Just as a general side note, if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms, I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms, so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.  This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish, but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later, the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more.  

The bread pudding was amazing.  Perfectly moist, with lots of flavor, and not too sweet.  

Service was excellent (Thanks Owen!), and along with the extensive selection of wines, they also have some more unique beers such as lambic, as well as a nice selection of non alcoholic sodas (The cream soda is locally made and very tasty!)",tri restaur week special chose stetson chop salad mix mushroom polenta bread pud stetson chop amaz prepar beauti bring tast perfect mix sweet savori crunchi soft salad mix tri testosteron salad decent fill lot well prepar beef quit compar chop salad gener side note choos restaur week menu chop salad mushroom think flavor chop salad bold mushroom mushroom tast bland happen transit salad main dish took mushroom home go box ate later delic flavor show appreci lot bread pud amaz perfectli moist lot flavor sweet servic excel thank owen along extens select wine also uniqu beer lambic well nice select non alcohol soda cream soda local made tasti,0

"I am totally baffled why this place gets such good reviews. I have been there a few times because it's close to my work and I received some gift certificates for my birthday. Unfortunately after the last experience, I can't go back.  Although they are very nice and have great prices, I have to reveal the ugly truth: 
1. They don't put any effort into sanitizing the tools or the pedicure bowl. I actually saw them clean the brushes and tools in the water I was soaking my feet in and then just rinse out the bowl after they were done... not spray, soap, nothing!
2. Reason #1 probably explains why my heals cracked so severely after my pedicure that they began to bleed.  I had to use peroxide, neosprin, and bandages for almost a week to get it heal. 
3. They water down their nail polish... so much that it destroys the bond and polish never actually dries.

"My roommate and I stopped by here  on a Saturday night with my groupon to see how this Fuego is holding up. I've been to Fuego Bistro before, and it was amazing, so this one at CityScape had a lot to live up to.

I'd say this place gets less than 5 stars based on atmosphere. The place kind of feels like a cafeteria and the vibe from the entire patron situation is just bleh. The best part about the atmosphere was my own company and that of our server, Brandon, who was really helpful and chatty.

Also, while my roommate got the Chile Relleno, which was okay in my opinion, I had the Fuego Tacos with pernil (which apparently is pork), and they were delicious. I absolutely loved and devoured them. 

Some other key points: The drinks were very tasty and parking is very easy. We parked at a meter (which is free after 5p), and I'm told they can validate the parking ticket for the underground parking.

Overall, I'd come back here.

"I got my first Kindle. This is a nice ebook reader. I'm going to jump right in and tell you what I found to be its Pros and Cons. Then I'm going to tell how it compares to its biggest competitor, the Barnes Noble Nook Simple Touch.Kindle's Pros:Great Screen: Many people do not find LCDs hard to read on (e.g. smartphones, tablets, Kindle Fire, Nook Color, etc.), but virtually everyone will find E-Ink easier to read, any time of day. Especially the newest E-Ink Pearl displays. They simply look like paper and ink. I have never experienced any eye strain reading E-Ink book readers, but I have with LCD based phone/tablet screens.Thin and Lightweight: This Kindle is thinner than any paperback and lighter too. This makes it very easy to hold in a sitting position, and for long periods too. It also makes it easy to transport in a purse, backpack, or messenger bag (or in luggage for traveling). Many people like to take a few books when travelling, and this Kindle lets you take as many as you want and adds virtually nothing to your travel burden.Good Value: Even without a touchscreen, the Kindle is a good value. It is a well-made product, it offers cloud storage of your books (and well it should, since it offers no ability to expand storage capacity with an add-in microSD card), the screen is excellent, Amazon is a dogged competitor in book pricing. The Kindle 4 is the best value of Amazon's E-Ink readers. Some may be tempted to get the version with the built-in light. If you can afford it, sure, go ahead. But let me point out you don't have to spend 20 for a fancy-schmancy book light. Your local dollar store has them for ... wait for it ... a buck.Read more",got first kindl nice ebook reader go jump right tell found pro con go tell compar biggest competitor barn nobl nook simpl touch kindl pro great screen mani peopl find lcd hard e g smartphon tablet kindl fire nook color etc virtual everyon find e ink easier day especi newest e ink pearl display simpli look like paper ink never experienc eye strain read e ink book reader lcd base phone screen thin lightweight kindl thinner paperback lighter make easi hold sit posit long period also make easi transport purs backpack messeng bag luggag travel mani peopl like take book travel kindl let take mani want add virtual noth travel burden good valu even without touchscreen kindl good valu well made product offer cloud storag book well sinc offer abil expand storag capac add microsd card screen excel dog competitor book price kindl best valu e ink reader may tempt get version built light afford sure go ahead let point spend fanci schmanci book light local dollar store wait buck,0

"Uh-oh. Where am I? 

The view from atop the mountain is superb. The city can be seen in all directions. Look, there's Downtown 1 and Downtown 2. And a bunch of houses under construction. And look at that sky. Wowza. 

Ok, so stopping to enjoy the view is one thing. Stopping to figure out where the hell you are is another. ""Don't worry,"" I told my friend. ""This city is laid out in a grid. If anything, we can walk down the other side of the mountain and cut back across on the street."" Oh, little did I know. 

Let me give you the back story. I've been to South Mountain twice. The first time was Christmas Eve 2006 when hardly a soul could be found. I met a friend there and we blazed our own trail. He always had his jeep in sight, so no harm in getting turned around. I trusted him to be my guide. 

The second and last time I hiked South Mountain was in February. My best friend flew in to Phoenix for the weekend (for my birthday) and since the weather was so great (in comparison to Detroit), she wanted to be out in the sun as much as possible. No problem. I knew where we could go for a good hike. Little did I know we'd get lost. 

We parked at the 24th St. entrance and picked our path, the Mormon Trail. We were on our way to discovering religion, we joked, passing by several other hikers. When we reached a recognizable summit, we stopped to appreciate the view... and then ponder our location. Should we turn around and go back the way we came? Were we still on the Mormon Trail? Where were the markers, the loops, the signs from God? We looked at each other, each of us having a take-no-prisoners personality when it comes to conquering great piles of rock. ""Onward!"" we shouted, punching the air with our fists. 

A little while later, we were once again stopped, our eye squinting against the retiring sun. I wouldn't call us ""lost,"" as this point in time, but that's only because I'm too stubborn to admit such an error. ""Let's ask somebody,"" I suggested. So, the next hiker dude that passed by, we stopped to ask him, ""Will this trail loop back around?"" ""Where do you want to go?"" he asked. That's when I realized we had tied our tennis shoes tight only to march into a rocky labyrinth. I told him where we parked and he said it was a good 2 hour hike back to our car, yet about another mile or two to the 48th St. entrance. Oh, no problem, I thought, since the city was laid out like a grid. Little did I know there are exceptions to that. 

We pressed on, thanking our impromptu guide friend. We hiked and hiked and hiked, passing by fellow hikers and mountain bikers. Finally, the trail opened up to flat land. We were close, or so we thought. When we reached the end of the trail, there was no parking lot and no street connecting us to where we needed to go. Instead, there was a long gravel road that weaved itself through a golf course. W.T.F.

We set out to walk the long gravel road until we hit Baseline, in which we were determined to cut back Westward and find my car, the only way we had of getting anywhere. The sun was setting. We had no time to waste. 

Having hiked about 15 miles already, our feet were heavy, like cinder blocks. But, we continued on. ""Let's hitch a ride,"" I suggested. People were gathering in their wonderful Ford pick-up trucks and jeeps. Hikers are friendly, I thought; somebody was bound to accept our plea for help. We opted to just do this ourselves. 

That's when a car slowed down. ""Ugh, creep,"" I thought. Instead, it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit. He asked if we needed a ride. My best friend and I exchanged glances. I thought, ""We can take him."" After a 70-second long pause, we accepted. She hopped in back and I rode shot gun, leaving my seat-belt off and the door unlocked, in case of a speedy getaway. 

We chit chatted on the drive down the road, which lead to another road, and then another and another, until we finally touched Baseline. Where the hell were we? That's when it hit us. We would have been walking another 7 miles on foot back to my car. All these windy, disjointed roads. Damn golf course. Damn South Mountain. Damn unmarked trails. It should change its name to the Moron Trail, for we just blazed it enthusiastically. 

The kind hiker man dropped us off at my car and drove away. With a sigh large enough to blanket the skyline, we unlocked my car, got inside and drove away - away from South Mountain, nature's beast and practical joker. 

We counted the miles and the minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car. Another hour, at least. The sun would have set by then and we would have missed our dinner engagement. Lucky for us, we stopped the right hiker friend at the right moment; otherwise, I may never have made it home to write this review.",uh oh view atop mountain superb citi seen direct look downtown downtown bunch hous construct look sky wowza ok stop enjoy view stop figur hell anoth worri told friend citi laid grid anyth walk side mountain cut back across street oh littl know let give back stori south mountain twice first christma eve hardli soul could found met friend blaze trail alway jeep sight harm get turn around trust guid second last hike south mountain februari best friend flew phoenix weekend birthday sinc weather great comparison detroit want sun much possibl problem knew could go good hike littl know get lost park th st entranc pick path mormon trail way discov religion joke pass sever hiker reach recogniz summit stop appreci view ponder locat turn around go back way came still mormon trail marker loop sign god look us take prison person come conquer great pile rock onward shout punch air fist littl later stop eye squint retir sun call us lost point stubborn admit error let ask somebodi suggest next hiker dude pass stop ask trail loop back around want go ask realiz tie tenni shoe tight march rocki labyrinth told park said good hour hike back car yet anoth mile two th st entranc oh problem thought sinc citi laid like grid littl know except press thank impromptu guid friend hike hike hike pass fellow hiker mountain biker final trail open flat land close thought reach end trail park lot street connect us need go instead long gravel road weav golf cours w f set walk long gravel road hit baselin determin cut back westward find car way get anywher sun set wast hike mile alreadi feet heavi like cinder block continu let hitch ride suggest peopl gather wonder ford pick truck jeep hiker friendli thought somebodi bound accept plea help opt car slow ugh creep thought instead help hiker friend summit ask need ride best friend exchang glanc thought take second long paus accept hop back rode shot gun leav seat belt door unlock case speedi getaway chit chat drive road lead anoth road anoth anoth final touch baselin hell hit us would walk anoth mile foot back car windi disjoint road damn golf cours damn south mountain damn unmark trail chang name moron trail blaze enthusiast kind hiker man drop us car drove away sigh larg enough blanket skylin unlock car got insid drove away away south mountain natur beast practic joker count mile minut would taken us get back car anoth hour least sun would set would miss dinner engag lucki us stop right hiker friend right moment otherwis may never made home write review,0

"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV.

"When I walked through the swinging doors around noon on a Sunday, I walked into Hooterville.  Think silicone, fake tans, bleached hair and  teeth and caked-on makeup.  And the men here overdose on testosterone: full of bulk and attitude.  Think sideways baseball hats, torn jeans, flip flops and gold.  Even at noon on a Sunday, they were on the hunt.  

Joining me in alienation was my San-Franciscan friend.  We represented the world of natural size and color.  To bring ourselves comfort and escape in this fake world surrounding us, we discussed environmental concerns.  

I got the Buffalo Chicken sandwich.  Commensurate with the theme here, this was the biggest breast I'd ever seen.  The sauce was super hot and tasty.  The baked beans had a southwestern flare - with crushed pepper.  My friend got the chili, which he said was slightly spicy hot but not temperature-hot.  

I didn't attempt the bucking broncho, for many reasons, but one of them being that there was nothing on it to hold on to.

Everyone is in and out and the train is on it's way again. The ride across the lake is a beautiful way to enter Tempe. From there, it's just a short walk to Casey Moore's and all the other spots I enjoy in Tempe.

"One word to describe this hotel: quality. The pools were all warm and unique. The hotel has two hot tubs, one that changes colors at night and is next to a man made stream, the other is on its own ""island"". There are two pools, a lazy river, and a small pool. The rooms were comfortable and the whole facility was clean. One thing that must be commented on is the staff was not only efficient but they were very friendly and nice. All of the food and room service I ordered was filled with superb flavor and had good presentation. The hotel also has a botanical garden, herb garden, multiple lawns, and it contains different food services. I highly recommend the ranchero pulled pork tacos and the sushi.

"I can't even believe I actually went to this restaurant.  My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience, it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste.  Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so....  Let me be clear that I'm not a food snob at all.  Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very, very much.  That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama. 

The decor was comfortable and breezy.  Everything else  - not so much.  1st it's nice that they bring you bread and butter, but a sweetly flavored butter?  Why mess with the pure goodness of butter?  The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet, and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth.  It was undrinkable until I cut it with water.  The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce.  So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp.  I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty, and in my opinion, contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat.  

As it was my friend's birthday, they brought him a complimentary dessert.  Very nice. He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust, chocolate mousse topping, sprinkled with crushed Heath bar.  Sounds good, right?  Vile, absolutely vile.  Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter.  On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though.    

My final issue was with our young, highly attentive server.  He was very sweet and well-intentioned.  However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective.  Don't say ""are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?"" or ""are we ready for dessert?""  Unless I've badly misinterpreted our relationship, ""we"" aren't doing anything together. Just a pet peeve -  I still tipped him 22% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk.  

oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy, quesadilla, cup of crab bisque, lemonade and glass of white wine?  $52.  for lunch.

"June 18 is not only the Father's Day but also my older daughter's birthday. She turns 6 years old this year and we thought that tablet would be a nice birthday gift for her. Her younger sister has Fire 7, so it was logical for us to buy Fire 8 for her, as she's older.We bought this tablet for her more with an educational purpose, than to watch cartoons. My husband is a software engineer and he really wants our daughter to learn how to code. There are so many different apps for that.We have already tested it today, when the tablet arrived, but haven't shown it to our daughter yet.There are three different colors and we chose the blue one, as it's her favorite color. It's very bright, the case looks like removable foam shell, very sturdy and easy to grab. It's actually a very nice decision of adding yellow color because when brother and sister share one device, it's better to go neutral.There is a possibility to expand storage up to 256 Gb, but I think 32 Gb on board will be more than enough for my daughter.Big cutouts make it easier to access to the volume and power buttons, as well as the charging port and headphone jack.The display is ok for the price. When I watched Peppa Pig, images looked sharp and colors were vibrant, even at extreme angles. The sound is much better here than in Fire 7 Kids Edition, and that's due to dual stereo speakers.I don't know how easy and intuitive the interface will be for our daughter, but for us it was great, nothing odd or unnecessary.

"Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? 

Be entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?

Are you 50 years old and Caucasian?

Then the Golden Buddha is the place for you! 

Its in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. 

For dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting ""real Chinese"" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.

The best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. 

They do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.

"I LOVE Laser for Less (Chandler)!  If you are going anywhere else for Laser hair removal you need to stop now and call to make an appointment with Laser for Less, Chandler.   I wasted a lot of $$$ at another Laser removal place before I found Laser for Less and now I am kicking myself for not going to them first.  If you pay to wax any part of your body you should be lasering that hair off.  It works better, lasts longer, and in the long run is cheaper.  

Pros - 
1. Free touch ups 14-18 days after your first appointment if they missed 1 hair they will touch up for free.  Never had a problem with them discouraging me, in fact it was the opposite they give me reminder cards so I know when my touch ups are due.  They encourage you to come in.
2. They can also charge you by the laser shot instead of a whole area.  So if you only have a few random hairs they will just charge 10 cent per shot on the legs or 70 cents on the face or smaller areas.  You can't beat that deal.
3. I am pretty sure they beat or match all prices in town.
4. Once they laser the hair, all your hair will fall out and wont grow back for like 2 months, its better than waxing.  Not all laser removal places use the type of laser that does this place does.  That is why I recommend them, it works a lot better!
5. They actually care about getting rid of unwanted hair and will go over all their policies with you.  Kristen is who I go to and she is great.  I have been to almost all their girls and they are good. 
6. In fact when it was my birthday month I didn't know I got some discount and they back credited me for it, I feel like they are always trying to get me the best deal.  
7. They always have deals.  Just last month they had their underarm extravaganza where you can get your underarms done for $30!!! That is so cheap.  They let you buy up to 3 sessions.  I referred a friend and she loved it so much because she didn't have to shave her underarms the WHOLE summer.

"This is a great place in an extremity of the Valley. They serve both Korean and Japanese food. They are quick and attentive. Having lived in South Korea for two years, I can honestly admit that this is some of the most authentic Korean cuisine I've had in Phoenix. I typically ate bibimbap once a week minimum over there and I can't really tell the difference between Takamatsu's version and the stuff I had on the other side of the Pacific. I noticed they offer a list of other, more obscure foods I learned to love over there, including naengmyeon (cold, spicy noodles), japchae (stir-fried glass noodles), and several other dishes. They also follow tradition and bring you several side dishes. Love it or hate it, kimchi accompanies every meal, as do spicy bean sprouts, a tangy spinach dish and a few other random sides. It's a little bit more expensive than average restaurant prices in the Valley, but definitely worth it when you consider the sides that come with it, and a complimentary spiced tea for ""dessert.""",great place extrem valley serv korean japanes food quick attent live south korea two year honestli admit authent korean cuisin phoenix typic ate bibimbap week minimum realli tell differ takamatsu version stuff side pacif notic offer list obscur food learn love includ naengmyeon cold spici noodl japcha stir fri glass noodl sever dish also follow tradit bring sever side dish love hate kimchi accompani everi meal spici bean sprout tangi spinach dish random side littl bit expens averag restaur price valley definit worth consid side come complimentari spice tea dessert,0

"I went because several people I know raved about the place, because I'm a lapsed vegetarian and I'm always trying to get back on track and heard the veggie sandwiches were incredible, and because I'm a malt freak and found out they have malteds there.

I was disappointed. And my friend I was with who had been one of Stickler's die-hard fans said that, although it was okay this time, the place seems to have gone down hill.

Stickler's wasn't busy at all, maybe 4 tables of customers and 3 people in line, but although there were alot of workers behind the counter, the service was very slow. We had to wait a long time for our veggie sandwiches. Now my friend has been there when it was jam-packed and she said the service then was much quicker. We went about 2 so maybe the staff was worn out from the lunch rush earlier.

The bread was good, crunchy on the outside and soft inside but the vegetarian sandwich itself was boring. It's supposed to have Swiss, Provolone and American cheese on it. I couldn't even taste the Swiss or Provolone at all, the American over powered the sandwich and was more like a cheez-whiz type.

I'm always on the look out for a good malt, one that really tastes like a malt and not a shake. My chocolate malt tasted more like a shake and I wasn't impressed with the ice cream. My buddy liked her vanilla malt though.

The one thing I did like about Stickler's is that they have the small bags of Miss Vickie's chips to buy. It used to be you could buy big bags in the grocery stores but now the chips,which are the best kettle chips I've ever had, are just carried in certain deli and sandwich shops.",went sever peopl know rave place laps vegetarian alway tri get back track heard veggi sandwich incred malt freak found malt disappoint friend stickler die hard fan said although okay place seem gone hill stickler busi mayb tabl custom peopl line although alot worker behind counter servic slow wait long veggi sandwich friend jam pack said servic much quicker went mayb staff worn lunch rush earlier bread good crunchi outsid soft insid vegetarian sandwich bore suppos swiss provolon american chees even tast swiss provolon american power sandwich like cheez whiz type alway look good malt realli tast like malt shake chocol malt tast like shake impress ice cream buddi like vanilla malt though like stickler small bag miss vicki chip buy use could buy big bag groceri store chip best kettl chip ever carri certain deli sandwich shop,0

"Today was our first time eating here, so armed with great reviews from other Yelpers, we sampled a bevy of appetizers from the happy hour menu (daily from 4:30-7p) and shared a pasta entree. Of the apps, we had toasted ravioli, a platter of antipasti, and by recommendation from our lovely server, Amber, the stuffed eggplant.  The toasted ravioli was delicious-crispy and battered with a crust of parmigiana, melty cheese on the inside. A dip in the flavorful and slightly spicy marinara sauce finished it off.  

The antipasti platter serves about 2 light eaters, but for me and my spouse, it was a nice compliment to the two other shared appetizers. 

The stuffed eggplant was covered inside and out with gooey, cheesy goodness and marinara sauce.  This was to be the main portion of my meal while my husband had gorged on the appetizers, but after a taste, he started sneaking bites while I wasn't looking!  I added some chili flakes for a little heat, but It was very flavorful.  I'm not a huge melted cheese lover and would've preferred a little less cheese, but it was perfect for my husband.

The restaurant wasn't super busy when we arrived at 6pm, but by the time we left around 8pm, the main dining room and the adjoining small rooms were about 85% filled.  The prices were higher than what we normally spend, but we had been given gift cards by my brother and happened to come during happy hour, so it wasn't that bad at all. Our bill came out to about $17 without tip and we didn't order drinks.

"The Orange is a popular, well-reputed joint in my neighborhood. The Pizzaria is connected to a small bakery and deli. IMO, it's overpriced and over-rated. The parking is usually impossible and often dangerously full of gargantuan SUVs and expensive sports cars. 

There is valet parking available at times that is also overpriced, pretentious, and unnecessary. The parking lot is tiny and I need a valet to park my car? What a racket. Overflow parking is available on street in the bicycle lane (thanks a lot folks!)

I used to have coffee here in the mornings week-ends in the outdoor cafe', but the place has become a neighborhood nusiance. The orange caters to a clientele that largely appears to regard itself as quite UMC. Probably they should be located in Paradise Valley instead of eastern Phoenix.

I give it three stars because the food is good. That can't be disputed. The facilities and the company leave much to be desired though.

"My darling SO just looooooves this place, supposedly because they have a BLT that comes with avocado and a half-cooked egg on it. Ummm... OK. When he finally dragged me here, I realized he probably likes it because the waitresses hit on him. (Honeybuns, if you're reading this, they'll do anything for a tip. ANYthing...!?)

I got a veggie egg white omelet, which had all my favorite components of caramelized onions and broccolini, but it tasted as if they had sauteed the veggies in the drippings from the burgers that just came off the grill. Uh, gross. This alone takes the rating to two stars, and I'm not even a super-strict vegetarian. It's just disgusting. The English muffin was this weird little hockey puck that really served no purpose other than to serve as a vehicle for the tasty, homemade apricot preserves that came on the side. The chocolate cherry scones were delish and the coffee quite good.

The booth next to us held three 20-somethings (two dudes and a chick) downing mimosas, still wasted from the night before, who thought it fun to play their cell phones and/or iPods at high volumes. Just annoying as shit. Later, when I visited the swanky bathrooms, I saw the girl out crying in the lobby. Guess the swordfight didn't end well.

"Being a fan of the infamous Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in Long Beach, I was totally down for some chicken and waffles this morning.

HAPPY HOUR ON A SATURDAY!!!

Yes, every day actually! from 3-7pm and a late night happy hour too starting at 10pm!! How can that be true??? Well I guess in Arizona they know how to party! $11 pitchers and $3 pints, yes it could be a little cheaper, but hey it is a happy hour every day of the week! And their beer is really good! AND they will give you FREE samples of all of their beer too!!! This is like brewery heaven!!!

To top it off, a group of people came here in Crank or Drank shirts on their first ever biking and drinking tours and this was on their tour for good reason! Their Hefe is awesome, complete with lemon wedges of course, and their Sunbru was so so refreshing on that hot day in AZ! Adriana and I definitely had our fair share of pitchers, along with an order of their beer battered fries and their specialty ice cream cake! Well, that was actually roopas, and just an FYI, oreo crumb crust and Hefe don't really mix......so save the cake for when you are done drinking ha ha

But the waiters here (the ones that don't look like they are 15!!!!!) are helpful and friendly and nice, and you will definitely get carded here, even though literally I actually felt old here since all the girls look so young! Some of them must have had workers permits I swear!

"Since other people have gone into detail on the device, I will answer only the burning questions I had before I received mine. I was very happy with my Paperwhite and would not have bought this had mine not been stolen/lost (not sure which). My husband still has his Paperwhite, so I was able to compare them side by side.CAN I USE THE WALL CHARGER FROM MY PAPERWHITE TO CHARGE THE VOYAGEYes.CAN PRESSING THE PAGE TURNERS CAUSE REPETITIVE USE ISSUESI don't think so. You can turn down the pressure it needs (which is very slight) or you can turn it off completely and turn pages with a tap. It's actually nice to have both options.CAN YOU SEE WHERE TO TURN THE PAGES IN THE DARKNo. You can guess where the page forward area is, but the page back is a dot, so guessing would be difficult. But you can still tap to turn pages. Using a cover helps, as the edge of the cover would be right over the dot.DOES THE FEEDBACK BUZZ ANNOY YOU WHEN YOU TURN PAGESI think it does take a little getting used to, but you can turn it down, and I think I will not notice it after a while. (There's no sound it's purely tactile.) Months later: It's not distracting you forget about it.IS THE ADJUSTABLE LIGHT NICEI still do it manually. It doesn't adjust the way I'd like it to. Not as bright in good light as I'd like, and not as dim while my husband is sleeping next to me. Note that if you want to use the night light, you have to set that separately from Auto Adjust.

"Visited recently for the first time.  Enjoyed happy hour appetizers on the patio.  Cool place for outdoor dining, the waterfall added a nice background.  They offer smoking and non-smoking on separate sides of the patio.  Of course you know that if anyone is smoking, the entire area gets to ""enjoy"" the smoke.  Being a non-smoker, I would appreciate an true non-smoking area but being outdoors was too compelling to pass on this beautiful day.  Another small observation - the tables were too low for the chairs causing you to lean over to eat and the chairs were not comfortable at all.  

We ordered chicken quesadilla & crab cake appetizer.  The quesadilla was made w/ green chiles and cheese, served w/ green & red salsa.  Didn't care for the red salsa but the green was pretty good, rather mild.  A side of sour cream was all that was missing here.  Crab cakes were ok, nothing special.  Served w/ a nice side salad it made a very good small meal.  A side of some kind of orange sauce (chipotle?) for the crab cakes that seemed really HOT to me - skip this next time please.

"I came into this charming little establishment with a friend. We were sat pretty promptly and had drink orders taken. I had the iced green tea and she had water which was garnished with a slice of cucumber. I thought that was a nice touch. 

We both started with spring rolls - she had the salmon, I had the barbecue pork. Both looked good and mine was tasty. Then we had both had a bowl of chicken pho. It was really tasty, however expensive for pho at $10/bowl.

That said,  the food was good. Not the best Vietnamese food I've ever had, but yummy just the same. 

My only gripes were the little things. I've worked in the back of the house for a long time. So I know how much it costs to put this food together.  I just felt like everything was expensive for what it was. This is not a high end restaurant. Its a teensy little hipsterish Vietnamese place with minimal decor. Its a lunch spot essentially. My menu was printed on paper which is pretty commonplace these days so no big whoop. Unfortunately the menu looked like it had been used about 50 times. I understand re-using menus. Its totally common. To NOT do so would be environmentally irresponsible. It just looked really, really used and abused. Also, my dipping sauce ramekin had a huge chip in it. To be fair, I am hyper critical of EVERYTHING when it comes to service just because I come from a restaurant background.

"Sometimes you just want to give an A for effort...

Or maybe more than three lame stars.  As the two other previous reviewers have pointed out succinctly, the man who I assume to be the owner was extremely nice.  I made the 1.5 hour drive from Tucson to watch Avatar at Arizona Mills, and my friends and I decided to grab a bite before heading back.  We randomly drove down Baseline and pretty much stumbled upon this place.  Traffic going westbound towards the 10 was insane.  I mean it was bumper to bumper past Rural.  Anyway, I ask the guy who I assume is the owner why the traffic was so bad.  At first he didn't know, but then realized that the 60 was closed.  He politely recommended that we head south then cut across to get back to the 10.  

I ordered the Jerusalem Falafel sandwich. It was pretty good.  Though, in all honesty, falafel is not one those kind of dishes that one can gush over.  In my opinion, it's pretty hard to mess up deep frying ground chickpeas.  I ought to point out that the ingredients were very fresh.  This also applied to the side salad that comes with the combo meal.  My two friends opted for the gyros, and it looked good.  The meat was thinly sliced, which is somewhat different than others I've had.  They seemed to enjoy the meal, but I don't think they were quite overwhelmed by it either.  In fact, we didn't mention anything about the food during the hour and a half trip back home.  

The food is by no means bad at Pita Shack.  It's adequate to serviceable in terms of Mediterranean food.  The positives regarding the food have to be its freshness and price.  In fact, I spent no more than $8 for a sandwich, salad, and drink.  The service, as noted previously, is undoubtedly the most shining spot of the place.   As we were finishing up our meal, the guy who I assume is the owner offered us lentil soup on the house.  We declined after being quite filled and satisfied from our respective sandwiches.  I believe another reviewer had the same thing happen to him, and he had positive comments about it.  Now, for me it's was the food that really matters.  Accordingly, I gave three stars, as opposed to the four that I was close to giving.  Should I ever return to the Tempe area hankering for food in a pita, I would most definitely give Pita Shack another shot; if only to support a genuinely nice guy's business.",sometim want give effort mayb three lame star two previou review point succinctli man assum owner extrem nice made hour drive tucson watch avatar arizona mill friend decid grab bite head back randomli drove baselin pretti much stumbl upon place traffic go westbound toward insan mean bumper bumper past rural anyway ask guy assum owner traffic first know realiz close polit recommend head south cut across get back order jerusalem falafel sandwich pretti good though honesti falafel kind dish gush opinion pretti hard mess deep fri ground chickpea ought point ingredi fresh also appli side salad come combo meal two friend opt gyro look good meat thinli slice somewhat differ other seem enjoy meal think quit overwhelm either fact mention anyth food hour half trip back home food mean pita shack adequ servic term mediterranean food posit regard food fresh price fact spent sandwich salad drink servic note previous undoubtedli shine spot place finish meal guy assum owner offer us lentil soup hous declin quit fill satisfi respect sandwich believ anoth review happen posit comment food realli matter accordingli gave three star oppos four close give ever return temp area hanker food pita would definit give pita shack anoth shot support genuin nice guy busi,0

"As other reviewers I wish that the remote still came with the handy magnetic base like the first ones did. It does, at least, come with the battery still. Because I know the remote will disappear to a never been seen again realm without a home I have decided to swallow my irritation it doesn't come with a dock and buy one to use with it. From my research it looks like this is the best bet - TotalMount Fire TV Remote Holder. The Fire TV remote appears to be the exact dimensions of the Echo remote, so I'm hopeful this will be a great solution even though it irks me to spend another 10 on a solution for something that used to be included! **Update: I ordered the TotalMount Fire TV Remote holder and it works great with Echo Remote.**We have a few Alexa units in the house and aside from the original one that came with a remote I haven't felt the need to buy another remote. Unless you blast your music it is normally fairly simple to engage with Alexa (at least how we have our rooms setup) even without the remote. However, my 3 and 4 year old have recently become quite the Alexa fanboys - checking the time, asking for jokes, listening to their playlists we've set up.... one of them can articulate clearly and Alexa responds, and the other can not. Before frustration got to a crazy level I decided a remote for the unit they normally talk to was the key.They (and I) love that you don't have to say Alexa *just* right to get a response with the remote. You simply hold down the microphone button and start talking (no wake word needed). Happy campers now. The range is great, the Alexa unit connected with this remote is in the middle of the house upstairs and no problems with using the remote anywhere upstairs (about 2000 square), as well as from two floors down in the crawl space - tested simply to see if it would work, and it did!

"We-Ko-Pa has been prominently listed as one of the places to play if you are in Arizona.  I first played it several years ago, and it has become one of my favorite desert courses in Arizona.   There are two courses - Cholla, and Saguaro, and although they are both desert courses, they are somewhat different. The cholla course is an older, more mature course and doesn't have the same feel as the Saguaro course.  The Saguaro course can be walked, but has a wild side to it and to me, seems to have more elevation changes. That said, both courses are immaculate, wonderful condition, and a joy to play.

Over the years, I have played the Saguaro course more, but lately the Cholla course has grown on me.  Now when my golfing buddies come down, I always make it a point to play both courses with them.  This has led to some interesting memories.  

The first time we played, despite my warnings, one of the players wandered off the Saguaro course and found a Jumping Cholla.  He liked it so much, he brought it back to us - stuck all down one side of his body.  It took us quite a while to get them off of him - and then he wanted us to give him extra strokes. Not a chance.

Another time, one of my friends teed off on a par 3 on the Cholla course, and hit it into a dry creek bed. He seemed to lose his composure, and hit five provisionals, which also went into the desert. Then he found his first ball, and ended up with a par!!  Of course, we haven't let him forget the five provisionals...

I have read some comments about the marshals on the course, and in the past would agree. However, the last two times we played, the marshals have been very good - very courteous and very helpful.  The last time, while we were playing cart path only, one of the players was very slow (as usual) and the female marshal most diplomatically asked us to speed up.  She was one of the nicest, most courteous marshals I have had experience with, and consequently, one of the most effective.

The courses have a nice driving range, chipping and sand area, and putting greens. Unfortunately, they no longer allow you to use them, unless you are playing one of the courses (you used to be able to pay a daily fee to use them).

Finally, the service is friendly and courteous - from the drop off, to the restaurant, to the desk personnel, I have had nothing but pleasant experiences with the employees.

I think any golfer should experience these courses at least once - a visit would be well worth it.",ko pa promin list place play arizona first play sever year ago becom favorit desert cours arizona two cours cholla saguaro although desert cours somewhat differ cholla cours older matur cours feel saguaro cours saguaro cours walk wild side seem elev chang said cours immacul wonder condit joy play year play saguaro cours late cholla cours grown golf buddi come alway make point play cours led interest memori first play despit warn player wander saguaro cours found jump cholla like much brought back us stuck side bodi took us quit get want us give extra stroke chanc anoth friend teed par cholla cours hit dri creek bed seem lose composur hit five provision also went desert found first ball end par cours let forget five provision comment marshal cours past would agre howev last two time play marshal good courteou help last play cart path player slow usual femal marshal diplomat ask us speed nicest courteou marshal experi consequ effect cours nice drive rang chip sand area put green unfortun longer allow unless play cours use abl pay daili fee final servic friendli courteou drop restaur desk personnel noth pleasant experi employe think golfer experi cours least visit would well worth,0

"This place is absolute perfection.  From the setting to the service to the food, I loved every moment of it.  The only way I found out about this place was through Yelp.  You seriously are my trusty sidekick.  From the previous reviews I was a little worried that it might be packed, but then I remembered it was a Monday night so no worries.
Walking in the restaurant, it is quite small, but just absolutely adorable.  It really does feel like an upscale country home.  Wood lines the whole restaurant and they have mini chandeliers hanging over every table.  Even the touches of place setting are just perfect.
Our server was Gina and she was a complete sweetheart.  We started off with the Bohemian Sidecar and the Cucumber Vesper.  Both were absolutely delightful!  Then we moved on to appetizers, because while getting drunk is fun, I was really excited for the food.  We had the steak tartare and mussels in the saffron and white wine sauce.  I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top.  Put fried egg on top of anything and I'm sold.  Put fried egg on top of raw steak and I'm in love!  The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare, perfect timing!  The mussels were equally amazing if not more, and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread!  Well that, along with the bread and butter.  But that still wasn't enough for me!  I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness!
After Gina cleared that out of our way, she brought out the glass of Bordeaux and Rhone blend.  I hate when I don't have a drink in front of me, and she made sure that never happened.  Then the entrees came.  The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf, and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me.  Again, absolute perfection on both accounts!  I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy, with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese.  I'm getting hungry again just writing about it.  My bf loved his, but I still maintain that mine was better.  And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at $15 and $17.  Could life get any better?
Well apparently it could!  After we polished off our entrees, then came dessert and after dinner drinks!  We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise.  And the berries with the creme fraiche.  Heaven in my mouth!  We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini.

"Amazing work!

My dentist referred me to this place just down the street from her.  I was super scared, as I always am at the dentist, but the staff made me feel very comfortable.  They treated me like a patient at the hospital.  They were my angel nurses.  

When Dr Amin came in, the ""nurse"" was holding my hand and telling me when to breathe.  I was, of course, shaking like a leaf.  The Dr ""popped"" me three times in the cheek, and I was all numb.  When I say ""popped"", I mean it was an electric shock wave pop flowing through my face to my freaking eyeball that made me tear up a little.  (this was done by the needle of course going into my cheek)  It was the craziest feeling, but relieving at the same time.  I just breathed through it, and it helped.  After about a min, the Dr was working his magic.  In about 45 mins, he was all done, and I had like 4 canals.  And I didn't feel a thing!!  :)

I was very pleased with the staff, Dr Amin, and the work they did.  I highly recommend this place if you need a root canal done.

"We used to go to this UPS store quite frequently and had been satisfied with their service, but it has been at least a year since we regularly patronized the place.  However, we had a really unprofessional experience here recently.  We went there for rotary services for purchase of home which one employee refused to do and handed off to another employee (because as she under her breath, notary services were a pain).  This employee could not help us either as ""he had never seen anything like it, and he didn't know  want to  have anything to do with something that had power of attorney on it.""  I guess we are one of the first people around here to sell a home. While we waited for this man to do something, the employee who handed off our paperwork, tried and failed to scan a document to email and was quite verbal and (sorry) hickish about these ""stupid"" machines.  After looking at all was going on, we didn't want anyone here handling our notary services.  Eek - felt like we dodged a bullet.  Also, don't think I will be going there for any other services.

"The biggest tip for Last Chance is to go in with an open mind about what to buy.  Inevitably, if you're looking for rainboots and remember seeing a ton the last time you were there, there won't be a single pair to be found when you return.  This happened to me recently -- but, instead of the boots, I found an unopened package of Spanx (marked down from $36 to $7.97), olive-colored DKNY tights for $.97, and a pair of Hunter knee-high boot socks for $4.97 (for when I eventually do find the rain boots).

"I'm not generally a fan of restaurants located within a mall, especially if it's a chain restaurant. I just don't care for the mall dining atmosphere. However, Kona Grill really surprised me! Especially the seafood. For a restaurant located in a mall... in Arizona... the seafood was awesome.

There are 3 important things you need to know about Kona Grill:

1. The Sea Bass is melt in your mouth, oh my god, foodgasm, amazing. Our waiter recommended it to us and I was highly skeptical. I thought that he was pushing this dish just because it's the most expensive one on the menu. Well, aside from the fact that it's the priciest item at a chain restaurant, it tastes more like a 5 star dish that would cost double the amount somewhere else. I'm telling you, YOU MUST TRY IT! It has this pan seared taste that is to die for. (I also can't forget to mention that the Salmon is super tasty as well).

2. The Cool Cucumber Mojito is not only refreshing and delicious, but it is also less than 100 calories! It's pretty strong too. This drink is pure heaven for a mojito lover like me, and it gets extra bonus points since its low calorie!  

3. Happy hour!!! It's the best and it's always packed. Kona Grill has great deals with always changing specials (I suggest checking their website before heading over).

Just try at least one of these 3 things and you'll see why I'm such a fan of this place. Overall, when it comes to dining at Fashion Square Mall, Kona Grill is pretty impressive.",gener fan restaur locat within mall especi chain restaur care mall dine atmospher howev kona grill realli surpris especi seafood restaur locat mall arizona seafood awesom import thing need know kona grill sea bass melt mouth oh god foodgasm amaz waiter recommend us highli skeptic thought push dish expens menu well asid fact priciest chain restaur tast like star dish would cost doubl amount somewher els tell must tri pan sear tast die also forget mention salmon super tasti well cool cucumb mojito refresh delici also less calori pretti strong drink pure heaven mojito lover like get extra bonu point sinc low calori happi hour best alway pack kona grill great deal alway chang special suggest check websit head tri least thing see fan place overal come dine fashion squar mall kona grill pretti impress,0

"This new KFHD replaces last year's basic Kindle Fire. Although it has some cool new features, it lacks a camera, microphone, and HDMI port. For this reason, I'm glad I kept my 2012 model since it does have these 3 features! Here are my initial impressions of the 2013 Kindle Fire HD: I like the placement of the on/off volume buttons. Being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one. I never cared for the carousel (this is what you see when you turn your Kindle on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed), and now there's an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead, and the apps/books can be rearranged to your liking. I was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar (which is now being called home). I don't know why Amazon removed this option, and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel. But you can still bookmark your favorite web pages YouTube videos for easy access. When I play songs purchased from Amazon's MP 3 store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style. Nice feature, but it doesn't work on every song. This device has a cool new feature called Quick Switch, which allows us, when reading or using an app, to bring up recently accessed items with a swipe instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one.In terms of sound, I find it to be tinny and not as rich as it is on the original KFHD. But you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds. Ironically, music sounds muffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers. Holding it this way projects the sound out to you.Read more",new kfhd replac last year basic kindl fire although cool new featur lack camera microphon hdmi port reason glad kept model sinc featur initi impress kindl fire hd like placement volum button opposit side make unlik hit wrong never care carousel see turn kindl contain book app recent access option favorit show home screen instead app book rearrang like surpris web page longer place favorit bar call home know remov option also unabl last access web page appear carousel still bookmark favorit web page youtub video easi access play song purchas mp store lyric scroll karaok style nice featur work everi song cool new featur call quick switch allow us read use bring recent access swipe instead exit book use go back home screen open anoth term sound find tinni rich origin kfhd realli improv sound music wear good set ear bud iron music sound muffl unless hold landscap mode hand cover speaker hold way project sound,0

"To sum it up, this place was just not the place for me. Maybe I am just a fuddy duddy, but it seems that the clientele are cougar-like women, aged 30-50, with bleached hair and sequin tops. I expected a quiet wine bar, but instead it is more like a loud night club.

The hubby and I visited The Living Room on a Saturday night, so maybe the whole ""we-wish-we-were-a-club"" thing was just a once a week occurrence, and maybe, just maybe, I am totally un-cool, but we don't plan to return.

Food: Wine specials were fairly decent and priced well. Food was average (3 stars). We had a variety of bruschetta, a tuna salad and a strawberry salad - way too much dressing on both salads. 

Service: It took a long time to get a table (~30 mins), but it was Saturday night and crowded, so expected. Once seated, our waitress seemed more concerned with anything other than serving us. She was not very attentive at all. She asked for my order and walked away. My husband was like ""uh, I kind of want to order too""

Atmosphere: The overall look and feel of the place is pretty neat. It is a smaller restaurant with lots of patio/outdoor seating.

"This place is very good.  I have dined here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but Sunday brunch takes the cake.  Food is all extremely fresh, and tasty.

"when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.

well, i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY. 

it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you...

our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress. 'ill have a diet coke?'

then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.

i lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird. 

we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had.

"Five bucks for a bottle of Miller Lite says pretty much everything you need to know about this place.

Also, if you are planning on attending a show here, plan on paying for parking.

I have seen some terrible sound guys here, but it's hard to say if that is the fault of the Marquee - a lot of bands that would play here tour with sound people.

The majority of the problems here are problems with venues of this size everywhere in the country - the parking, the over-priced shitty beer, the strip-search upon entry, the lack of re-entry.

Still, if there was any competition for a venue in that part of the Valley that could handle bands that are as popular as the bands that play at the Marquee, they'd be hard-pressed to do a less-enthusiastic job of it.

"I should have taken my own advice and stayed far away from this place. Our most recent visit ended hastily when I was served rotten tuna and got barely a ""sorry"" from the staff. I could smell that the fish had gone horribly, horribly off when the ahi tuna salad was put before me by the waiter, and I'm shocked that the kitchen actually thought they'd get away with sending it out. The waiter disappeared so quickly from my table that I had to go hunt him down to point out the bad smell at my table was coming from the food, and he took my plate back to the kitchen and five minutes later came back to say, ""okay, we all smelled it and there's definitely something wrong there.""

Seriously? You had to go pass it around to confirm that I'm not crazy when you can clearly tell within ten seconds that this is not how raw fish should smell? After all this, their solution was to comp an appetizer, not the salad, and eventually gave me a new salad to go, which I decided not to eat just to be on the safe side. 

Look, I'm not scared to eat week old leftovers or sushi at a divey joint and I don't really get freaked out by the cleanliness of restaurants, but this could have been dangerous.  I have absolutely warned off all my coworkers and friends against this place, and now I'm warning all of Yelp.

"Went here about two months ago and am only now getting around to reviewing it. I think that should stand for something in terms of my experience there.

The service was ridiculous. If one is going to charge the prices they charge for regular Americanized asian food... at LEAST make sure the menus you hand people are clean. Or your plates for that matter. Or silverware. Seriously! Did EVERYTHING have to be covered in grit or a mysterious sticky substance?

Next up... the menu. Not everyone eats meat. How about a little more choices for us who prefer tofu over dead animal?

I ordered the Coconut Curry Vegetables. Bland bland bland. I've had more flavor out of an unseasoned packet of ramen. And would it kill them to actually put some tofu on the plate?

I guess I just don't understand the hype. The prices are ridiculous for the quality received.

"I will begin by saying that I've been wanting to try this place for months now, simply because they have a salad that bears my name. Which reminds me of my high school days, when the internet was new and I spent an afternoon with a friend visiting websites that also had our name. Most ended up being adult sites, but tonia.com* was an Asian company that had my name written in a fantastic logo. I wonder what it means. 

Anywho, not only does the salad live up to its given name, but Moto is now on my backup sushi rotation. Reasonably priced and of good quality, I was extremely full by the time I ate only half of my dinner. The Tonia salad I actually had for lunch a day later, and was very filling and delicious. I can only imagine what it would've been like eating it the same night. Had it not been as great, I would've never came back and written to the owners, demanding the salad change to a lesser awesome name, maybe one more common or boring.

"I will precede this lackluster review by stating the following:

1)I have only been to this place once.
2)I didn't get a chance to actually try the cuisine.
3)I am a sympathetic person to servers, as I have been one.

That being said, I give this place one star for reasons of poor service.

About six months ago, at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon, we decided to eat at this place. The atmosphere was warm and cozy; typical college bar with college-aged waitresses.

We made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers. The beers came, the food never did, and we watched other patrons come in, eat, and leave.  All the while, our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks (we got them ourselves from the bar). 

Since my bf and I both worked in food service, we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is under-staffed.  But after an hour of waiting, we finally crossed the room to speak with our server. She said, ""I can't imagine it will be much longer."" I think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket, which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook.

Where was the manager that day? Or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all?

We left money on the table for our beers and walked out.

"Went for lunch again with my wife and SIL yesterday.  Was pretty disappointed and they are losing a Star each of the last two times.  We ordered four entrees --  A combo Nam Yeung Noodle salad (I forgot the Korean name), Pork Tonkatsu, Seafood Tofu Soup, and a dinner portion of Kalbi.  We got there at 2:00 pm and we were immediately told that they plan to close at 2:30 pm even though their lunch hours are until 3:00 PM -- WTF??  So we ordered quickly.  Within a minute the tonkatsu order came out and it was cold; probably premade or something, and the meat used was very, very thin (again) so it was very dry.  The Seafood tofu soup and buckwheat noodle salad were OK.  The order of kalbi came out last, but not on a sizzling, cast iron plate, so the onions on the bottom were raw and not ""grilled and caramelized"".  

Don't know what is going on here, but each time we go, it seems that they are slowly going downhill.  So we have decided to look for another restaurant option for Korean food in our area.

I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill. He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school... I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else. They also did a poor job. I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers. Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them.

"I love love love consignment stores...and walking in this store, the smell was great...  however...

I have to say i am disappointed with My Sister's Closet. I had heard such great things, so I was really excited to go. They did have some amazing designer purses, including a $3400 jimmy chu purse that was huge and gorgeous for $1899.  

The designer section clothing was hung on nice wooden hangers with their logo (Nice touch). 

However....... The items I saw around the store, and my friend with me agreed, seemed like more than 40% really were more appropriate for a thrift store, and a lot of the items were really dirty (and still had high prices). You could see food stains on a dooney bag.. a coach wristlet, black, had white food smeared all over it... still highly priced for as dirty as it is. The thing is... even if it is a brand.. sometimes your store reputation is worth more than the 10 bucks you'll make by selling something dirty. Just my .02. 

I saw sensors put though jeans pockets, wallets (in the leather!) and other questionable placements. When I asked about it.. the sales person just said, well maybe there is someone new who does not put it in the right place. That damages items people are buying, and they may not realize the big holes placed by those sensors. 

I loved there ""on the web"" tags. I've never seen that before, but they are really pretty and catch your eye if you want to take a closer look. 

I prefer consignment stores to identify the sizes on the hanger by color coding or some such to make it easier to find my sizes. I get bored really fast trying to find my size..  As a consumer, I would have spent more time looking had I been able to really scan the racks easier for size.

The shoes are nicely organized.... and clearly labeled. They were not over crowded so it was easy to see the shoes. 

There are some positives.. I purchased a le sportsac tiny bag for 9.99, it was new so i do feel it was a good deal.  but really be careful what you buy..

"Ok, so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moron. Honest. 

So, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before. 

But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station. 

I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. ""Wow,"" I thought, ""It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying."" 

So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it. 

Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days. 

Only, it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off. 

Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.

After entering Dos Gringos we sat at our table for 21 minutes before a waitress came to our table.  She brought us 2 beers and never came back. After 40 minutes we decided to check out a new bar since we obviously weren't welcomed at Dos Gringos.  So we went up to the bar where I waited for 5 minutes so the bartender could take some pictures and shots with her friends.  What I didn't understand was there were maybe only 20 people there and at least 6 people working.  If I was the owner or manager I would be embarrassed to say that you run that establishment.

My hubby and I have been missing this place since it closed its original restaurant in Cave Creek. We heard it moved to Phoenix and we found it and went there this past week. Unfortunately, it was nothing like the old, hopping, smell good, smokey, fun filled environment of the original SF. 

I can see that they have a lot of regulars and the barkeep knew everyone that walked through the door, which to me,  was very cool, but it just wasn't gelling for me this night I suppose. 

We ordered the deep Fried green chili's and there was soooo much batter  on them, I had to really concentrate hard to find the chili. I ended up peeling all of the batter off of the chili's just to get a small bite. icky. 

I would give this another chance just because I hate writing a bad review. So, after the holidays, may check it out on a Friday night and see where it stands then, Also, I will hope that when I arrive next time, the smoker out back is kicking and there is some REAL BBQ to be had.",impress beer cold bar keep disinterest assist us atmospher drab place small go order terribl bbq day feel place hubbi miss place sinc close origin restaur cave creek heard move phoenix found went past week unfortun noth like old hop smell good smokey fun fill environ origin sf see lot regular barkeep knew everyon walk door cool gell night suppos order deep fri green chili soooo much batter realli concentr hard find chili end peel batter chili get small bite icki would give anoth chanc hate write review holiday may check friday night see stand also hope arriv next smoker back kick real bbq,1

Any other major city (like, say, New York), the cover would be at least $15, and they would make you pay for the second set, as well, and a place to sit or stand with a decent view of the musicians would be hard to come by, and by the end of the night you would end up feeling ripped off.  

Granted, this place can get crowded on the weekends, but no wonder.  The beer (no draft) and wine selection is good, the vibe is laid-back, and the music I've heard has been great (I've only see one group here--Jiggle--and they play jazz.)

Tip for music-lovers:  Sit or stand in the room where the music is.  Sitting any farther back and you may be tempted to take a swing at the people who just come to chat and fail to understand what makes the Lost Leaf so unique.  But do give them a bit of a break.

Their homemade salsas are worthy of bringing in your own jars to export back home -- some of my favorite salsa anywhere.  I believe they have three different kinds.  Their tequila options are wonderful allowing for creative margaritas or a fine neat glass of 100% pure agave goodness.  (I promise to never use that phrase again, sorry Readers.)

The entrees aren't just your common taco/burrito fare.  Using juicy meats, creative homemade sauces, and interesting pairings, Cantina Laredo professes its love for Mexican food and culture -- reminding diners how lovable these things are.

The decor and various areas are all quite nice as well.  An excellent complement to what always proves to be an excellent meal.

"After SMOCA opening night, I just wanted to relax with some friends and not go get wasted or have to wait a long time to get a seat at a trendy bar on a Friday night. Oh yeah, and get something to eat. I had remembered some generally good reviews of Drift, had noticed it when going to shows at Martini Ranch, and really wanted something with coconut (?).

After a terrifying short-cut with a walking GPS that I was sure was leading us to our death (or at least led us to dog-shit on the sidewalk at one point), we ended up here with a nice enough door guy. Inside I was really impressed. It was a lot nicer than I thought it would be, more sophisticated and while it was Tiki-themed, I thought it was very tongue in cheek COOL interpretation of tiki (very hard to pull off). 

We asked for a booth and got one near the door (which lead to superior people watching later). Our booth was creamy, spacious, left us with no ass swamp, (although the acoustics were a little bad-I had trouble hearing someone two people away) and showed us more intimate tables in very Ikea-esqe and mod black leather. This place is surprisingly classy. The giant aquarium at the bar was goregous and if I ended up here with one other person, I would def. sit there.

Our waitstaff was extremely sweet, the food (veggie spring rolls, coconut shrimp, and pot stickers) were not that expensive (5-8) and surprisingly good. Kristin and I got two orders of spring rolls. We took the longest time deciding drinks-I got the old fashioned Pina Colada in a coconut shell (YUM) and Erica got the Evil Bastard which was set on fire and it was damn potent. I was very giggly the rest of the night. 

Looking around, this WAS not a pick up scence. Groups of friends just sat around chatting. On the way to the bathrooms, a small open lounge was dominated by one party having a lot of fun. The bathroom sink blew my mind and I still don't know what sets it off...although my theory is some dude needs to flush the toilet for water to come down and vice versa. I started freaking out in my drunky state, saying ""I have soapy hands goddamit! And I'm smart! How does this shit turn on!"" wiping my hands on the sink with tiny amounts of water.

Overall, a very chill scene with a bizarre assortment of people (bro dogs, homely couples, musicians, barbies, and just regular folks) perfect for a second or third date for a casually romantic drink or two.",smoca open night want relax friend go get wast wait long get seat trendi bar friday night oh yeah get someth eat rememb gener good review drift notic go show martini ranch realli want someth coconut terrifi short cut walk gp sure lead us death least led us dog shit sidewalk point end nice enough door guy insid realli impress lot nicer thought would sophist tiki theme thought tongu cheek cool interpret tiki hard pull ask booth got near door lead superior peopl watch later booth creami spaciou left us ass swamp although acoust littl troubl hear someon two peopl away show us intim tabl ikea esq mod black leather place surprisingli classi giant aquarium bar goreg end person would def sit waitstaff extrem sweet food veggi spring roll coconut shrimp pot sticker expens surprisingli good kristin got two order spring roll took longest decid drink got old fashion pina colada coconut shell yum erica got evil bastard set fire damn potent giggli rest night look around pick scenc group friend sat around chat way bathroom small open loung domin parti lot fun bathroom sink blew mind still know set although theori dude need flush toilet water come vice versa start freak drunki state say soapi hand goddamit smart shit turn wipe hand sink tini amount water overal chill scene bizarr assort peopl bro dog home coupl musician barbi regular folk perfect second third date casual romant drink two,0

"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to.

Green Tea - Good.  Good service on the refills also.
Edamame - Good.  Right amount of salt.
Miso - Interesting wooden bowl and wooden spoon.  It tasted good, tho.
Yellow Tail, Salmon, Tuna, Albacore, Uni, FW Eel,  Kampachi nigiri.  Good stuff on all of those.  They also have ""Yasu style"" nigiri for some types, and they are good.  It usually involves ponzu on top.
Spicy Tuna and Softshell Crab roll.  SSC was great!

Service was pretty good and sushi was also good.  The bar was full but I wish I could have eaten there.  The sushi chefs were friendly and talkative to the people at the bar, which is unusual (at least compared to LA).  The base quality of the fish, outside of whatever ponzu, soy, wasabi and other ingredients were on it, was pretty good, but I wouldn't say 5 stars.

"I was not a particular fan of this place. Went on a Friday evening after work. A friend wanted to try it because we always enjoy supporting new, local places.

They do have a very large selections of beer but the process is very confusing. All of the beers on tap are written on a very large chalkboard above the bar. They use several different colors of chalk for each selection making it very hard to read. It may be easier if they pick one color of chalk for each type of beer, that way it is easy to find what you want. Or have #1-5 be one type of beer, #6-10 another and so on. My boyfriend spent so long trying to find a beer on the board because of this. Two of our friends were so overwhelmed with the way the selections were presented they just asked the server to surprise them with a choice.

"I ate here over the weekend while attending Comicon.  I was actually pretty hungover at the time and desperately needed to plug my gut.  It was between this and a deli I saw a little bit down the way but pizza always, always sounds good so I made my decision.  In my mind, in a fight between a pizza and a sandwich, the pizza would always win because it has the power of molten-hot cheese and pepperoni shields.

Yay:  It was like $6 bucks for a big slice of pizza and a salad and a drink.  That's a really, really good deal.  The salad that I got wasn't like an amazing salad but it had onions on it and croutons and had a strong flavor.  It wasn't bad.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, ""Throw a salad together super quick and cheap,"" and I got that salad, I'd give it a B.

Nay:  The pizza was not so good.  But, you know, it was pizza and pizza is hard to fuck up so it was salvageable.  The big problem was that it was so greasy.  I mean the pizza sweat grease like a fat man's back.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, ""Make me a cheap ass piece of pizza that tastes good,"" I'd give this slice of pizza like a C.  I choked that shit down though and washed it down with salad and raspberry iced tea.

So, you know, the pizza wasn't great, but after I got done eating I felt a lot better.  I had the strength and energy to check out Comicon for the rest of the day.

"I have a serious Banana Republic problem. Rewind time to about three years ago when I bought my first dress from BR. I had just gotten my first full time ""real job"" after finishing college and I needed a wardrobe to match my new position. It is now three years later and I have probably close to twenty dresses from BR. The only issue I have is they leave me pretty darn broke, so when I heard BR had a factory store I was stoked! So last weekend I dragged my husband, sister and niece down to Anthem to check this place out.

It was crowded, but the prices of the items definitely make up for it. That is, when you find something worth buying. The selection of items is a little weird, and you have to fight with many other women to get into the racks with the good stuff. But I managed to find two 100% cotton dresses that are both casual and work appropriate at the same time. Priced originally at $80 with a markdown to $40 on the rack, they also had a 25% off sale on these particular items that day. So I scored two dresses originally totaled for $160 for $60. Sounds like a good deal to me. I wish they had more colors, except that would have been bad for my credit card cause I am sure I would have ended up buying them all. My husband also scored two pairs of jeans, two cotton shirts, and three pairs of boxers for under $100. 

I can see myself making the 50 minute drive down here at least four times a year to see what new stuff comes in. My dress collection is going to get larger this year, I can tell you that. Also, if you sign up online for the factory store you can get coupons for extra % off your total purchase.

"OK, I went based on Tim C.'s Yelp review of this place, and I am so glad I did. I rode my bike up there around 1PM Wednesday afternoon, and I have to say I was not disappointed. 

Even though it was hot out, the outdoor table was surprisingly cool and comfortable. I got an iced soy latte and it was so good. I don't know how to explain it, but there is great tasting espresso and there is bland espresso. This place just has great tasting espresso. I found out while I was there that Ted (the guy who made it) had roasted the beans himself. You can buy the beans from them if you are one of those industrious people who grind and brew your own espresso drinks...I am not. I prefer to leave that to the professionals.  He actually ground the espresso when I ordered my drink. If you get the chance please go see what I am talking about. You will notice how much better the espresso is.

The place itself is so beautiful and relaxing. If you sit outside like I did, you are basically sitting in a big outdoor garden. It is kept cool by the overhead canopy and the swamp cooler air blowing out from inside the coffee shop. Ted was really friendly, I felt comfortable just hanging out for a while reading my book. Unfortunately, the coffee shop closes at 2 PM, otherwise I bet it would be beautiful at night. This place definitely looks like something that would be in a cool little town somewhere, and  not off of a busy street like Hayden Rd. 

Ted also told me he makes the lemonade himself fresh squeezed, something I love and will definitely try. When I go back, I think I will go a bit earlier.  I may do a bit of plant shopping as well while I am there...

"Let's rewind four years:

""You've never been to Chino Bandido?""
""No, what is it?""
""How long have you lived here?""
""About eleven years, but a bunch of those years were when I was a toddler, and I just moved back from a few years in Flagstaff.""
""And you've never been to Chino?""
""NO. What is it?""
""Amazing.""
""Take me there.""
""Okay.""

Yet we never went.

On the drive home from the Children's Museum of Phoenix, I realized that I was hungry, on a budget, and Chino Bandido was not too far off of path.  I ran the plan by my father, checking to make sure that would be an appropriate Father's Day dinner.  I received a confused look and thumbs up.  He's not the most adventurous when it comes to dining experiences, but is generally a good sport.

If my friend and I had been on the ball, I could have been eating here for four years.  Granted, I rarely have business around 19th and Greenway, but I could have made Chino Bandido my business.

We both ate a perfectly reasonably sized and delicious dinner for less than $10.  Three cheers for Caribbean influenced burritos and homemade teriyaki sauce.

Stevey P mentioned the only reason I'm giving four instead of five stars: If the dining room weren't so disgusting that I had trouble eating in it, it would easily be a five star place.

"Wow, I am very impressed. The store is very big, and they seem to have it all - even the hard to find, odd items. It looks like everyone can shop here.

The store is mapped out and sectioned nicely too. Finding things is easy, and if you can't (or don't want to) the very friendly staff are there to help. It looks like they employ people who know a thing or two about the supplements also... so whether you are looking for: digestive health, immune support, weight loss, muscle building, herbs, beauty or whatever; they have it, and they can tell you about it! Pretty Good! 

You can even get a customer rewards card and build up bonus points to get discounts and stuff. And they can track your purchases with it should you ever (like me) loose your receipt!

What I am really impressed with though is their customer service and return policy. I did not expect them to accept a return and refund my money on 2 items that I purchased there because I lost the receipt. Especially, since I did not purchase it on a member card so they could not track my purchase either. I thought I would try my luck with it anyway and was hoping for an exchange. Well, the clerk was so nice to me. She said that it was no problem and would gladly refund my money (I didn't even ask for a refund)... and I had opened one product. I was speechless and felt a little guilty about it too - since it was almost a month that had passed (I really didn't think they'd take them back). Anyway, I told her that an exchange would be more than appreciated, and she said, ""No problem:-)"" again! So I very guiltily walked over to get some of the items I needed. They had them and they had them on sale - cheaper than I have ever seen and in more of a selection too. 

Needless to say, I walked out of there very happy (but feeling a bit undeserving). But that is what good - EXCELLENT - customer service is all about - exceeding the customer's expectations! 

This I my new store for all of my supplements and health & wellness needs. I recommend checking them out. They seem to have everything one could ever need. Plus, they have an entire wall (and more) dedicated to muscle, weight and fitness - if that is your thing!

"I came here for the first time on a rainy Tuesday afternoon for lunch with a great friend I hadn't seen in 6 months.  Our server who was cute as a button picked up our ""we are not in a hurry vibe"" right away.  We ordered a bottle of wine, fairly priced and loved the added touch of a chilled wine glass.  Our food was very good but no real risk was taken. We shared the fish and shrimp tacos which were flavorful but I had to add some hot sauce to give it a little bite.  The beans and white rice were a simple filler, nothing more.  The menu looked interesting and the prices were fair so I would definately try it again.
There were only 2 things that I found disapointing, first was after we ate I ordered a martini, one from their menu, it was fruity and you couldn't taste the alcohol at all.  The problem was it was served in a very small martini glass and I feel when you are going to make a fruity concoction and call in a martini the glass should be bigger, not the James Bond shaken not stirred size.
Second problem, as we were eating a woman came and sat at the table right by the restrooms and plugged her computer into an outlet that made the cord block the restroom door.  Now my companion and I couldn't decide if she worked there or not, she never ordered food and wasn't there long.  But just the fact that the cord blocked the door and could have been hazardous really bothered me.

"Minnie and I stopped by Papago Dog Park today on a whim... 

It was a beautiful day and since she was such a good girl in the car with me and at my afternoon meeting, I wanted to reward her.  Rather than travel out of our way to go to Chaparral Dog Park (our usual dog park destination), I remembered seeing this place, specifically the fenced in / off-leash area, and we swung by.

It was just after 4pm, and there were a handful of dogs there, and more were coming the longer we stayed.  It's a lot smaller than Chaparral, and the grass is not the healthiest I've seen... Unfortunately, there were several areas that owners didn't clean up after their pooches too.  (Come on, owners, you give the rest of us a bad name!)

Anyways, we had a nice 30 minute visit... Minnie sniffed out a few other dogs from behind and then they returned the favor to her.  Don't you love how they socialize with each other?!  Too cute.

Anyways, will this become our dog park of choice? No.

"I am definitely quite shocked at some of these reviews. I disagree with the lack of flavor, and the tasteless dishes some reviewers experienced while eating here.

 I recently moved over to the N. Phoenix area, and while craving some Vietnamese food a few months back, I decided to  browse ""Yelp"" to find it. I came across these reviews, and decided to check it out regardless of the poor comments of this establishment. I phoned in my order without looking at a menu,  ( Chicken Pho, Egg Rolls,& Spring Rolls) nor  knowing where they were even located, I eventually found it in the little nook of the Fry's shopping center. I walked in to a very tiny little restaurant  with a cute little man standing at the cash register holding my wonderfully smelling  food in hand.

 When I got home, I realized that he had forgotten to add the Noodles (which obviously is the  biggest part of this dish) I was a little miffed but eventually got over it, once I tried the appetizers we ordered,and the wonderful flavor of our pho. I knew it was such a harmless mistake so I didn't hold it against them. After consuming our wonderful and inexpensive meal I came to the realization that THIS is my new Fav Vietnamese spot in the N Phoenix area.. I've eaten their at least 5 times since I found this place in Jan. That says something in my mind!! 

In my opinion they  beat Pho Bang, and Avina HANDS DOWN!!  It's clean, inexpensive, flavorful, and definitely NOT tasteless.. A definite treat if you ask me.

"I am being generous with my review. I am biased since this place has been one of my favorite restaurants for years. I love it in Georgia and this place continues the tradition of rocking faces off - Italian style. 

I went to this locale for my birthday party with about 20 friends (unbelievable, I know). This place was more than accommodating. The waitress was fantastic, even though we were a pain in the butt come check time. I took her suggestions for our family style dinner and not one disappointed. I highly recommend the Rigatoni D and Chicken Prosciutto. Both were fantastic entrees. To top it off, we finished out with killer tiramisu. 

There is nothing bad I can say for this place. The atmosphere is what you would  expect from a large italian restaurant. I personally love that their waiting area is also the bar. That is just good thinking. It truly is a killer place that is perfectly nestled in north Scottsdale.

"This is by far my favourite department store, hands down. I have had nothing but perfect experiences in this store, without exception, no matter what department I'm in. The shoe SA's will bend over backwards to help you find a specific shoe, and the staff will even go so far as to send out hand-written thank you cards to your home address after you make a purchase - big or small. Tim & Anthony in the shoe salon are fabulous beyond words! 

I am not completely sure that I understand why people complain about the amount of merchandise on the floor or the lack of crowds in this store. Frankly, I would rather not be bombarded with merchandise and other people. One of the things I love the most about Barney's is not only the prompt attention of SA's, but the fact that they aren't rushing around trying to help 35 people at once. The SA's at Barney's are incredibly friendly and will stop to have an actual conversation, regardless or whether you are purchasing something or not. I have also never experienced a ""high pressure"" sale situation here.

All in all, Barneys is pricey, and there is no getting around it. But, um, so is Neiman's and that place is a crock.

"Brought a group to Metro for brunch, made the reservation a month ago, called three days ago to update and ask to be outside and people arrived and were told there was no reservation. Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldn't accommodate. 

Having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic. Not enough menus, slow, horrible drinks, no silverware, soup was burnt-how do you burn soup??? Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us. 

I host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro. 

They have recently changed management, unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation don't hold true anymore.

Update 11/8/2010
Since my first review I received a $50 gift certificate from the management of Metro.  I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with 5 of my friends.  I knew I couldn't just go with one other person, it had to be a group to show what they could do.  

We arrived at 9:15 and were seated on the patio.  I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough, I never saw her again.  There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full.

Jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly - it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu.

"My friend who I was visiting and I went here for a fundraiser type of a deal.  I don't know what I was expecting but I really liked the island concept of the place.  My friend recommended a salad and I got a Caribbean chicken salad with some sort of coconut rice, chicken,  oranges, pineapple, tortilla strips, etc.  Well, the salad was huge!!!  The honey lime dressing was very flavorful and complimented the salad well.  We shared the rumbi fries, which were a combination of sweet and regular fries, and as aforementioned in some other reviews, I love the sweet potato fries and wish they all could have been that (do I sound like the Beach Boys?).  

The decor was pretty cute and the music was great (Marley, Buffett type stuff).  The rice bowls looked fantastic, as did the sandwiches.

"I forgot they built a bunch of FF places along Deer Valley Rd over the last several years, until my bro Daren C reminded me (shout out).

I've been making the rounds to various area Arby's using the shit out of the free BBQ Bacon Cheddar Roastburger (arbys.com/coupon and today's the last day!)

I thought I'd try out another store to avoid wearing out my welcome on Bell Rd., and I'm glad I did.

This is a clean, efficient operation.  The building's pretty new, with a large dining area full of a variety of walled areas and nooks and crannies, giving many of the tables a private feel.
There's even a big atrium window, and a real, live 15' or so ficus tree growing indoors out of the floor in the dining area.  Great atmosphere for this kind of place.

The service was quick and friendly.  I could tell that the young guy at the counter thought the manager barking orders was being a dick, but he took it in stride, smiling and saying ""yes, sir"" the whole time.  ""richard"" the manager was only doing what it takes to keep a FF store running smoothly, though, and young guy will someday get a job selling cars or something, and look back thankfully on all 'richard' taught him about  upselling and add-ons, smiling and being friendly. 

Bad on Arby's for getting rid of regular french fries, though, as they now only have curly or potato cakes (which are great, but i always appreciate variety).

"I feel bad giving them a mediocre rating but I'm reviewing what's in their NAME. I drove about 9 miles across Gilbert (that is quite a chore) because I wanted to serve good roast beef sandwiches for dinner and I needed good bread. 

I had Boar's Head roast beef, tomatoes, horseradish sauce, avocado, roasted red peppers etc I just needed great bread. Where else in Gilbert should I go? I did a Yelp search and it agreed - to this place. 

I arrived around 4:15 and the pickings were slim. I got the last round of sourdough and a small nine grain. I asked her to slice thick, she walked to the slicer and said it has one setting. Okay I'll slice myself. 

Because I love Cupcakes I also took a chocolate cupcake and my boys got a chewy brownie each. The total was about $16. 

We got home the bread was hard (both) soft on the deep inside so I had to grill the sandwiches with butter not my plan but it's butter, butter fixes everything. 

The cupcake frosting was good I ate the top threw away the 'cup' not worth the calories. I only allowed the boys to eat half the brownie each and save the other half for tomorrow as they were huge. The said they were really good. 

Basically, I'll buy my bread at the grocery store or at Paradise bakery as the wasted gas and time in the car was not worth it.",feel give mediocr rate review name drove mile across gilbert quit chore want serv good roast beef sandwich dinner need good bread boar head roast beef tomato horseradish sauc avocado roast red pepper etc need great bread els gilbert go yelp search agre place arriv around pick slim got last round sourdough small nine grain ask slice thick walk slicer said set okay slice love cupcak also took chocol cupcak boy got chewi browni total got home bread hard soft deep insid grill sandwich butter plan butter butter fix everyth cupcak frost good ate top threw away cup worth calori allow boy eat half browni save half tomorrow huge said realli good basic buy bread groceri store paradis bakeri wast ga car worth,0
This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the service went way down hill.  The new owners hire lots of college students with tattoos everywhere as well as lots of piercings.  Seems like tattoos and too many piercings are a job requirement along with disrespect and a lack of desire.  The staff is what made this place the worst restaurant ever and doesnt seem to matter how often you let management know I just dont think they care.  Also in the past few years there is a growing number of homeless that sit out front begging for money.  They sit so close to the outside patio that you have them dining with you or at least it feels that way making you incredibly uncomfortable.  Our last visit we sat on the patio which was next to a bench just outside the restaurant where a few homeless were stationed.  One girl had a huge rat on her shoulder and it was beyond disgusting.  Management obviously doesnt care and does nothing to improve anything so we go way out of our way now to eat at the other Greek in Chandler at Chandler Mall.,use favorit restaur servic went way hill new owner hire lot colleg student tattoo everywher well lot pierc seem like tattoo mani pierc job requir along disrespect lack desir staff made place worst restaur ever doesnt seem matter often let manag know dont think care also past year grow number homeless sit front beg money sit close outsid patio dine least feel way make incred uncomfort last visit sat patio next bench outsid restaur homeless station girl huge rat shoulder beyond disgust manag obvious doesnt care noth improv anyth go way way eat greek chandler chandler mall,1

"The first couple of times I ate here I wasn't sure why people were always so crazy for this place. It's been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months I've already been here like three times and wanted to go back more. I've decided that it's all about what you order; for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings, have fun! Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try. Also, don't be afraid to speak up. I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didn't pay attention. Now I ask for lots of lettuce and they're happy to make it the way I like. They make their breads fresh and they have garlic-herb bread that has lots of flavor. I won't order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing. I am a picky ranch eater...I hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesn't taste or resemble mayo. I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor. They have the best home made ranch dressing here! Pair it with the garlic-herb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor. OMG! Wipe...sorry I just started to drool a bit. Service is good...everyone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant. My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwich...I get the Pinner (8"") but I swear some days I am so hungry I think I'm going to order the Blunt (12"")...maybe someday soon. All sandwiches get toasted. Okay so toppings: Guacamole, sprouts, lettuce/spring mix, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, black olives (I get mine w/o), cucumbers, pickles, your choice of cheese (I get Swiss), with their house goodies (EVOO, vinegar, herb mixture on top). Now that I found my sandwich, I crave it all the time and can't wait for my next visit. Oh, be sure to check their daily specials too!

"I'm giving Yoli's 5 stars for the winning combination of great food for a great price at a quaint location.

Went there on a Saturday late in the morning and we were seated right away.  Great little hideaway in downtown Chandler.  I ordered the Morning Monte.  It was delicious.  My family ordered various other items and we all sampled a bit off each others' plates and everything was excellent.  My favorite item was the chorizo burro.  Excellent chorizo with the correct combination of meats and spices.  The waitress was friendly and we chatted with the owner and she was very nice also.

Another really great thing about this place is the prices.  I don't think there are any items above $8 and most meals here are in the $6-$7 range.  Very reasonable for the good quality food you get.

After breakfast we took a walk around the courtyard and had a nice time looking around at the plants and exotic birds they have on site.

This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.)

"Oh lawd!!!

So, I'm a relative nevercomer to this cuisine. Like most people, I hear 'Szechuan' and I think 'just spicy Panda Express food'. Meh. I couldn't have been more wrong.

I was in Atlanta with a friend, and he took me to a place that specialized in Szechuan cuisine. I had my first experience with Szechuan peppercorns there, and I was hooked. All I can say is, if you haven't already tried authentic Szechuan cuisine, then you owe it to yourself to give this place a shot. And if you HAVE, then you already know what I'm tombout and you probably already eat here all the time any damned ways. 

Enough other reviews have touted the wonders of that amazing spice, the Szechuan peppercorn, so I'll let their words be the guiding lights of wisdom for that. What I'm gonna tell you is- I travel all over this great nation of ours, and this place delivers the goods, in the way that I want them. The food is inexpensive, it's reliable tasty, and it's exactly what it's supposed to be. Other people have complained about the service, and to that, all I can say is:  ""get over it"". It is what it is, and I haven't had any problems here. Their food is exactly what it should be, it tastes exactly like it's supposed to, and I love it.

The rest were over cooked or hard as a rock.  We really wanted to love this place as I kept trying more and more of the meats as they came around hoping the next one would be better.  Besides being hard, the meats didn't have much flavor.  The salad bar was okay and I don't know that I would even pay the cheaper price to just eat from their salad bar.

It is a little pricey, but for the amount of food they serve and all the leftovers, I think it's worth it.  The best way to go here is with a group and do the family style menu.

"3 1/2 Stars.

Girl's choice last night.... and we (my sister, my niece Carol, and myself) ended up at the Famous Dave's in Chandler. These Famous Dave's look like every other one... typically bright Orange and Yellow! At night, you must have deficient eyesight if you can't find a Famous Dave's! In the evening, Famous Dave's is just a lighthouse beacon in the middle of a drab mall!

On the menu...

Blue Margarita (** 1/2) made with Blue Curacao - It's disconcerting when the last time you saw your niece she was just drinking Cokes... now it's Blue Margaritas. Must be getting old. In summary... not very toxic. Could have drank this in one gulp and wouldn't have had an effect! Machine mixed and made. Looked cool, though, with an Aquamarine Blue color.

All American BBQ Feast (****) Gimmick is that all this stuff ( Full Slab of St Louis style SpareRibs (*****), Whole BBQ Chicken (*** 1/2), 1/2 lb of Texas Beef Brisket (*****), Famous Fries (*****), 2 Baked Potatoes with all the Fixin's (*****) replaced the Coleslaw and Wilbur Beans, 4 Corn on the Cob (***), 4 Muffin Style Corn Bread (****) ) is served on a bright, shiny, galvanized Garbage Can lid. Some of the items definitely lacking in BBQ flavor.

Hot Fudge Kahlua Brownie (**) Warm, Walnut covered Chocolate Brownie, soaked with Kahlua Liquer and topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Hot Fudge, and (loads and loads of) Whipped Cream. Ice Cream and Kahlua was no-where to be found!

Total tab: $82.08. Not bad for the amount of food.

Service (****) This is a total generalization... but what the heck! The wait-staff at Famous Dave's is totally opposite from the previous evening's robotic lifeless performance from the wait-staff at Olive Garden ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-garden-italian-restaurant-chandler#hrid:l6HajH2UNtb1EZMTj19Ccg  ). I really don't give a darn if it's just a performance... the attitude that the wait-staff presents will be passed onto the customers... whether bad or good.

Typical of all Famous Dave's you sit at a booth or table covered with Red and White checkered table-cloths. At the front entrance is a display of all the BBQ awards that Famous Dave's BBQ items have won.... mostly in the MidWest. Check out the lead-pipe utilitarian interior design... Cool!

"I don't frequent Tempe too often, but when I do, I try to get a Tea Infusion run in... everytime I succeed, I literally have a grin on my face after every sip. 

It's the least strip mall-esque dining option in the whole of Tempe Market place and that is a BIG PLUS in my book. Add to that that they make Boba Smoothies the way I like them... how could I resist?

Case in point: The Pumpkin Chai. Based off the rattlings of fellow yelpers, I decided to try the chai and asked if it could be boba-fied (which makes me want to say Boba Fet) and they said ""SURE!"" It was delish, but that was summer and now it's winter and so warm sounded yummy but I had never had a hot boba drink before. So I asked them if I could have it with boba and hot and what did they say? ""SURE! But be careful it's hot."" And oh so YUM!

I think they deserve the taglines ""Have it your way"" and ""Any way you want it"" more than Burger King! Because out of all the Boba places in Metro Phoenix they are the only ones that have never said ""No"" to me before with Boba Juice coming in a close second.... but only because their range of options is less.

Add to that that they have a Boba Smoothie called Carribbean Colada and it is a pretty comparable alternative to my favorite Pineapple Lychee flavor that only the now defunct AZN of Mesa could prepare for me... so with just 2 of their drink options I am in Boba heaven... wonder what else they have in store for me if I ever tire of my usual options and try something different... don't know if I can... I might have to do a gluttonous double order or sip-taste from a friends selection.

But wait... Boba's not all they've got, they've got a tea list comparable to that of Cheesecake Factories menu... it is a long one... I've had a blueberry tea, strawberry and a coconut one and they were all pretty tasty. I've also had a panini there and it was quite tasty and filling--I took leftovers home.

My only wish is that the space Tea Infusion is housed in was more spacious with lounge seating in addition to table options so one can really settle in and work or chat with friends, but heck, I'm just happy they're here and serving the valley some tea-tastiness.

"I have had to change the batteries in this remote once or twice per month since I purchased it in March. After the battery's short life span after the first battery replacement, we stopped doing any gaming with it and just used the gaming controller. It did not make a difference.

"I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night.
Service was excellent, and highly attentive.
Food, absolutely horrible.

My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. 
What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. 
What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. 
Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet
Veggies, blah.
Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. 

In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. 

I've had it with this place.

"This review is for the second generation Kindle Paperwhite. Like all kindle e-readers before it, this is a great product. However, I am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. For this review, I focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new Paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. Also, I found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising, so I will try to clear them up.HARDWAREDesign - The Kindle white has a nice look and shape. It fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. It's fairly light, so it doesn't tire the hands too much. I can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. Its design is very similar to the previous Paperwhite - almost identical. The height and width are the same, the buttons are in the same location, and although this version is slightly lighter, it is not noticeable.Display - Although not a huge improvement from last year's model, the display is one of the best features of the Paperwhite. Like most e-readers, the Paperwhite uses digital ink technology. This model employs a more advanced version. In addition, the lighting has been upgraded, so among other things, it is more evenly lit. Together, they make for incredible viewing. In my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. I really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain.Processor - The Paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. I am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. There is barely any lag as I flip through many pages at a time. Also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.Read more",review second gener kindl paperwhit like kindl e reader great product howev bit disappoint huge improv last year model review focus featur enhanc exclus new paperwhit tri make comparison last year model also found someth misrepres confus advertis tri clear hardwaredesign kindl white nice look shape fit well easi hold hand fairli light tire hand much grip long period switch hand design similar previou paperwhit almost ident height width button locat although version slightli lighter notic display although huge improv last year model display best featur paperwhit like e reader paperwhit use digit ink technolog model employ advanc version addit light upgrad among thing evenli lit togeth make incred view opinion best digit ink e reader display market realli enjoy read text look sharp crisp littl eye strain processor paperwhit upgrad processor mean smoother page turn navig abl open book flip page navig menu fairli quickli bare lag flip mani page also flash effect turn page show less,0

"To sum up what I will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation Fire HD and the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of the iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new HD Fire. If you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, I'd recommend the regular Kindle Fire HD that is only 139. If you're comparing last year's HD model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to the original Fire HD as well as this year's model of the Fire HD, but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the Kindle Fire HD, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the Fire HDX attempted to download and install several operating software updates. Software updates on a Kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. Consistent with the Fire HD, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a TV show, and reading a book. It took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.Read more",sum tell detail get good deal comput especi compar last year first gener fire hd spend wi fi version ipad overal consid price function think great tool toy watch lot video play lot game video qualiti outstand realli tell differ new hd fire first buyer price vs valu key consider look afford kid recommend regular kindl fire hd compar last year hd model version oper fine say save money continu get money worth review compar lot featur version fire hdx origin fire hd well year model fire hd also featur first user consist experi setup year model kindl fire hd setup took long despit brand new product fire hdx attempt download instal sever oper softwar updat softwar updat kindl usual background annoy watch crash manual reboot consist fire hd crash setup play song watch tv show read book took littl hour get run without consist crash final softwar updat work expect without issu,1
"Newly opened no frills supermarket import from the UK with interesting ethnic food selection.

The fruits and vegetables wrapped in clear plastic sitting on black crates reminds me of my neighborhood Tesco's from my days in London.
 
Cool thing about this one is the variety of products carried on the shelves.  When's the last time you're seen tripe or pig's feet at Albertson's or Safeway.  And hooray, I can finally buy Chaokoh (the only good brand of coconut milk) in Scottsdale without having to trek all the way down to Lee Lee's or Ranch Market. 

Great selection of fresh meats and cheeses.  The only place apart from Trader Joe's that I've seen unpasteurized orange juice, which by the way tastes way better because heat kills the fresh taste.

"I am not a big beer drinker, so I can't attest to the many different options they have in that area, but I can tell you about their martinis.

They have a huge menu of specialty martinis and other cocktails that are all pretty darn tasty if you ask me.  My friend really liked the chocolate something or other martini, I had a pear one that was delicious and another pal really enjoyed the pomegranate press.

The food is pretty good or I was buzzed.  Or both.  We had the cheese pizza and an onion ring tower (both half-off for happy hour).  Which, by the way, truly is a tower of onion rings.  And then the waitress brought out a free piece of cheesecake for my birthday.  It was a great time had by all. 

But the best thing about Yard House is the location.

"Well, our initial plan was to go to Tuck Shop as I've been wanting to try it out. Unfortunately two ladies got there 1 sec before us and got the last table, the waiting area was packed with a group just hangin' and they had a 16 ppl reservation for later. There had sitting available right away at the bar but I'm pregnant and my back is killing me so bar stools were out of the question. They were very apologetic, which I thought was nice considering if wasn't their fault. I'm glad they're doing well. So I asked my husband if he wanted to try District and off we went. Actually, I made a reservation in case something happened and well, we ended up there.

Nice and spacious, not crowded at all.  They were part of AZ restaurant week and we ordered from that menu.

Shrimp sliders- I loved them! They should have a big version of it!
Duck quesadilla- Very good as well, but I'm partial to anything with goat cheese.

We both got the country chicken steak and it was really good. Mine came 1 med, 1 small pieces instead of a big one. The med piece was a bit dry and the breading was slightly burnt. The smaller one was perfect, juicy and crispy. The breading flavor was really good, slightly  spicy. The biscuits were awesome!! More of a cake-bread texture, light and fluffy and kind of sweet. Green beans were tasty as well.

Strawberry shortcake whoopie pies with lime basil sorbet ( I think it was a sorbet)- It was good, but not something I'll order again. The pie filling was too sweet, even the tartness of the sorbet couldn't help it.

Service was prompt, no hovering or having to wait for too long and our food came at a perfect pace.

"Chain restaurant that's just about okay for afternoon dining with friends. If I wasn't having beer at lunch I'd probably suggest eating someplace else. Food is good but in my experience their beer makes the meal. I've eaten here about half a dozen times during the past few years when in town for business weekends.

It is centrally located on the corner of Mill and Fifth Street in downtown Tempe, amongst quite a few other local restaurants. During my most recent visit I ordered a steak at lunch along with one of the seasonal brewed beers. Steak was okay but I wouldn't order it again. Beer was exceptional, so I wasn't unhappy overall.

I love burgers and I think I'll stick to that as my primary choice when eating here in the future. I can't think of any times when service was particularly unsatisfactory, nor were there times when service really stood out as exceptional. I have almost always eaten here on a Saturday afternoon, and it's typically been fairly busy during the lunch hour. Never had a problem getting a table, which is important since I'm usually heading back for an afternoon conference session.

I love the big glass beer mugs (not sure what size they are) but I can't always down the whole thing during a short lunch break (I'm a lightweight).

"Was in the area for a grad school interview and the BF was craving some red meat. Came here based on yelp reviews, left pretty full, content about the food. 

Service was friendly enough, but we had some trouble communicating what we wanted. We settled on the kalbi, bulgogi and the ribeye? steak meats, with an order of the tofu soup. Everything was a-okay but I think the only thing that stood out was the ribeye. Normally we like to cook the meat ourselves but since we didnt want to stink on our plane ride back to cali, we decided to let them do it for us. Side dishes were standard with the different pickled veggies, kimchi, potato salad, etc. Waiters were pretty prompt in bringing out replacement side dishes for us.   

Since we don't know the area very well, the stars are good service, being open at odd hours (I think we got there at 4pm?) clean restaurant, decent food. -2 stars for small portions and no real wow factor.",area grad school interview bf crave red meat came base yelp review left pretti full content food servic friendli enough troubl commun want settl kalbi bulgogi ribey steak meat order tofu soup everyth okay think stood ribey normal like cook meat sinc didnt want stink plane ride back cali decid let us side dish standard differ pickl veggi kimchi potato salad etc waiter pretti prompt bring replac side dish us sinc know area well star good servic open odd hour think got pm clean restaur decent food star small portion real wow factor,0

I have to say that if you happen to go on a day that there's a large party going on, it kinda like you're an unwanted fly on the wall. This play town is located in a large older shopping center that blends in with the other faded store fronts. Inside, the owners seemed to be very nice, although stressed due to hosting a party there.

"An upscale mexican restaurant in the area seemed like the best thing to have happened to me. I planned my visit for a quieter evening, and reviewed the menu again and again. 

However, upon our arrival I thought twice immediately. The parking was iffy, and the place didn't seem to stand up to the signage. Perhaps the art was not to my liking, honestly not a piece stands out in my memory. 


We were seated immediately. 

Our waiter seemed a little off, not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen, where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is). 

Halfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes, easily), the lamp above our table went out. We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed. Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls. 

When the food finally arrived, we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left. Unfortunately, we took our grub with us.
I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce. It's no coincidence you're taken aback by the combination... it didn't go down too easily. Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal, though, we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand. 

Normally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right, but since I am recommending that you not go there, why bother?",upscal mexican restaur area seem like best happen plan visit quieter even review menu howev upon arriv thought twice immedi park iffi place seem stand signag perhap art like honestli piec stand memori seat immedi waiter seem littl mention fact insan snobbi seem moonlight kitchen disappear minut fill soft drink without first flag experienc close quarter understand ridicul halfway wait food took minut easili lamp tabl went sat dark good minut even notic actual nice chang sceneri bore beig wall food final arriv tire due finish entir bottl wine left unfortun took grub us sort mix seafood entre chorizo creami sauc coincid taken aback combin go easili drop dollar meal though felt compel finish much could stand normal would make sure got name dish right sinc recommend go bother,1

"What a shame this place is doomed. From a flavor perspective, I have never found such an interesting Asian/fusion style of food in a quick-serve setting. The food is remarkably rich and spicy, it's really refreshing to see a mass-market place be so bold. Being so deeply impressed initially, I really, really wanted to like this place. I have since given it about three or four tries. Yeah, not so much.

First of all, I'm not sure whether it's the quality of the meat, the parsimonious manner in which it's cut or some combination of the two, but their meat is always tough and stringy. When its breaded, the breading is inevitably chewy and hard because the meat inside the breading is so insubstantial that all the moisture gets sucked out in the frying process. Not even the chicken comes in substantial enough chunks to be juicy. 

The amusing thing is, what made me like this place at the outset was the delicious sauces. You're enjoying the sauces so much you can easily overlook how crappy the meat is. Alas, that will only take them so far, as time and time again you are reminded of the crappy meat as you are compelled to floss vigorously.

Portions are another issue. They're too small for the price. Instead of takeout containers overstuffed with rice and entrees, grandma-sized portions are stingily arranged on a small plastic plate. I never have a problem finishing my entire meal and I always wish there was more. 

I think Pick Up Stix has a bit of an identity crisis. On the one hand, they want to be Pei Wei, all flashy stainless steel and fancy real estate. On the other hand, come on folks, it's takeout faux-Chinese (""pick"" ""up"" - see what they did there?). The best takeout faux-Chinese is always known for generous portions at low prices. At Pick Up Stix, you unfortunately get neither.

The patronage reflects my opinion about the place each time I go: it's always nearly empty. I really don't expect it to last. That's a shame, I really will miss the unique flavor profiles.",shame place doom flavor perspect never found interest asian fusion style food quick serv set food remark rich spici realli refresh see mass market place bold deepli impress initi realli realli want like place sinc given three four tri yeah much first sure whether qualiti meat parsimoni manner cut combin two meat alway tough stringi bread bread inevit chewi hard meat insid bread insubstanti moistur get suck fri process even chicken come substanti enough chunk juici amus made like place outset delici sauc enjoy sauc much easili overlook crappi meat ala take far remind crappi meat compel floss vigor portion anoth issu small price instead takeout contain overstuf rice entre grandma size portion stingili arrang small plastic plate never problem finish entir meal alway wish think pick stix bit ident crisi hand want pei wei flashi stainless steel fanci real estat hand come folk takeout faux chines pick see best takeout faux chines alway known gener portion low price pick stix unfortun get neither patronag reflect opinion place go alway nearli empti realli expect last shame realli miss uniqu flavor profil,0

"Jason Silberschlag pulls off a pretty amazing thing here in the metro-PHX area.  Three shops with their own quirky details, passion and identity.  Each tailors specifically to the demographic at hand, which I can totally get behind.  The fact that each shop has its own deal going on is awesome - I really dislike chains and the chain feel/look.  I hadn't seen Jason in a while at the other shops, the times I'd frequented, and was happy to see him behind the bar when I came here for the first time.

Just the same way the other Cartel shops have a selection of brewing methods, this one does as well.  Pour-over, aeropress, Chemex and traditional espresso (La Marz GS/3).

As expected from him, our drinks were flawless.  He transfers this knowledge and passion to the baristas, which is obvious even when one leaves his establishment to go somewhere else - they stand out in the crowd of many coffee-pullers.  The beans, who can complain?  Jason made his name with the roasting.

I got a prepared sandwich here, and my was it tasty.  Bread was fresh.  Sauce, ingredients and overall creation was good.  Big Ben: you stole my tastebuds' heart that morning.

"While I am giving this restaurant four stars, I must start off by noting that the pizza here is mediocre.  If you want spectacular pizza in Phoenix, don't kid yourself that it's at I-17 and Thomas.  It's over at Pizzeria Bianco.

However, the other items on the dinner menu are worthy of a visit to the 'hood.   The Penne alla Vodka ($12.95) offers up pasta in tomato sauce with bacon, fresh basil cream and vodka.  It is an excellent starter to split with a dining companion and that's exactly what the BF and I do every time we visit this place.  The Cozze Posolipo mussels in garlic white wine sauce ($11.95) are also quite tasty as an appetizer.  The complimentary warm pizza dough they serve with an onion and olive topping is a nice touch.  For entrees, the Pollo Parmigiana ($14.95) is the classic breaded chicken breast with marinara, mozzarella and parmesan cheese served with penne.  The Lasagna della Casa with Bolognese sauce ($13.95) is very good, but the portion is a bit stingy for the price.  The BF often enjoys the Gamberi alla Pana ($15.95) that includes jumbo shrimp sautéed with mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce over a bed of fettuccine.  Please note that the brandy cream sauce is extremely rich.  Another tasty option is the Spaghetti con Salsiccia ($13.95) with mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and Italian sausage in marinara sauce with a touch of white wine.  The Cheese Ravioli ($13.95) is another great choice with the tomato cream sauce.  For dessert, be sure to order a Cannoli Siciliani ($5.95) as it's the very best I have had in Phoenix.  The Tiramisu ($5.95) is good as well.

The bad news is that this place is no longer BYOB.  For whatever reason, the management decided that a restaurant that seats no more than 20 needed a full liquor license.  I really hope that the investment in that spendy license doesn't lead to the undoing of this place.  Given that they don't even have a bar area and I almost never see anyone order a mixed drink, I think staying BYOB might have been a better choice for this neighborhood joint.

The service at this place is also part of the show.  The waiter may well be manic as he will either be way up or way down for your visit.  The décor here is pleasant enough given the location of this tiny restaurant in a modest strip mall.  If you happen to need a trip to the restroom, you will get the chance to traipse through the kitchen.

Here's Why ... They have a live band and over sixty beers on tap.  It's a nice cozy environment especially if you sit outside.  Budweiser drafts were only $5 and soda was only $3.  We didn't try their food but I hear the same owner owns both Copper and Stand Up Live so I am sure the kitchen is the same so I am confident in saying that the food is delicious because it was at Stand Up Live.

Happy hour is 4PM to 7PM Sun-Thurs so its basically perfect when any event is taking place during on those days.

On this Satuday night people were having a good time.  The draft beer was perfect and fresh.  The music was good and the bartender was real friendly and answered all of our questions cheerfully.

"""We wanted to take you out for your last dinner...so we got to thinking 'what place has specials on a Tuesday?'..and I remembered Chompie's has a special..AND A FOOD CHALLENGE.""

And THAT is how I ended up at Chompie's on a Tuesday.  They were featured on TV (I think it's Man Vs. Food, but I'm not sure) bc of this food challenge of theirs.  On Tuesdays, they have a special - AYCE Jewish sliders & fries with the purchase of a beverage for $11.95.  (Keep in mind, a plate of 3 Jewish sliders + fries is $11.95.)

I was told the specialties here are sliders.  The sliders themselves are a decent size (I'd say maybe it's the same size as the tiny McD's burgers, but taller?).  Jewish sliders have potato cakes in them; Western sliders don't; breakfast sliders are something completely different.

Everything we ordered was ehhhh (befitting of a ""meh, I've experienced better"" rating).  Two things that did impress me, however, were:

1. They place pickles on the table right when you sit down!  I'm not a pickle girl myself, but it's a nice gesture.
2. Everyone here is so FRIENDLY (I mean genuinely friendly!!).  Idk, I think most Arizonians in general are friendlier than the Californians I encounter on a daily basis hahahhaa.  And our waitress went out of her way to split 5 checks for our party of 7...that was pretty cool of her.

"OK, yeah, everyone LOVES teriyaki, we know!

Well, don't so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here!  It may look like a little pre-processed Japanese hole in the wall from the outside, but they're a die hard home-made mom and pop your mouth full of great food establishment!

I'd highly recommend trying the Katsu bowl! You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ, yet they have an excellent one that's very traditional, but not too expensive! I'd love to explain the mystique of this dish, but too many people think that fried egg with onions and leeks topped over a diced pork cutlet that's coated in panko bread crumbs is too strange to be palatable.  Well, to them I say you should educate your tongue, and expose it to some delicious culture! 

There's also Orange chicken... This dish is completely the bee's knees. It easily and without remorse makes Panda Express look like a burnt out oil can that a homeless person decided to cook some chicken in over a pile of burning newspapers.

Their house beef? Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms? Heaven.  Simple and delicious.

And I haven't even mentioned their coup de grace yet.  Their fried rice might seem a little ""heavy"" on the surface as it's lightly fried with some garlic oil, but it outclasses all competitors.  Paired with their lightly fried shrimp, it's sweet garlic love.  Seriously, their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices.

As I've been eating here for far longer than I'd like to admit, I'd have to say I might be a little biased.

"I used to frequent this place when it was Long Wong's.  The food wasn't good back then but it was open 24/7 and always available.

Since the change in ownership, I have been repeatedly disappointed.  The size of the menu has gone down drastically (which is understandable, Long Wong's menu was way too big).  They only serve slices of pizza at certain times of the day now (noonish until 3pm supposedly I think? and again some time in the evening) and you never know if they will actually have slices.  I understand that maybe they don't sell that many slices in the off hours, but I would gladly take a slice of pizza that was an hour or two old over none at all.  Not to mention even at 3pm it is not uncommon to get a pretty old slice anyways.

The burgers are so-so.  Better than McDonald's, but just really not that good.

I've only had the cheesesteak once, and boy was it a disaster.  I bit into it and what must have been a full cup of liquid poured out of it.  I'm not sure how this was possible, but it was almost like it was sabotaged.  I'm sure this was a one-off problem and that they are not normally like that, but I was horrified and have not tried another.

The owner is eager and you can tell he is really trying to make the business work.  However, the staff he hires can be very rude sometimes.  I've heard some snotty tones of voice saying they had no slices when I've tried to order a slice of pizza during the off hours and have been refused a simple refill of my soda when my order took far longer than expected.  That said, I have not been there in a few months so this may have changed.",use frequent place long wong food good back open alway avail sinc chang ownership repeatedli disappoint size menu gone drastic understand long wong menu way big serv slice pizza certain time day noonish pm supposedli think even never know actual slice understand mayb sell mani slice hour would gladli take slice pizza hour two old none mention even pm uncommon get pretti old slice anyway burger better mcdonald realli good cheesesteak boy disast bit must full cup liquid pour sure possibl almost like sabotag sure problem normal like horrifi tri anoth owner eager tell realli tri make busi work howev staff hire rude sometim heard snotti tone voic say slice tri order slice pizza hour refus simpl refil soda order took far longer expect said month may chang,1

- No cover.

The potato salad was very flavorless as well.  The rib tips would have been good if they weren't covered in 5 gallons of bbq sauce, nasty bbq sauce at that.  Their sauce is like a sweet and sour sauce...was not good at all.  The hot links were mixed in with the rib tips and covered in the same sauce.  So couldn't tell if they were any good, cause there was so much of that damn sauce.

The funny part was that the couple that ordered right after me, got their food and took it right back to the counter and straight out said that the food was just disgusting.  I wish I would have done the same instead of spending $15+ on nasty bbq.

The area where this event happens is not very big.  Seating is a B-I-T-C (shut your mouth!) I'm not even going to bring up the Shaft!  However, come early enough and maybe you'll get lucky.  Some people to do the ""I'm saving these seats for a friend"", thing, which really really is annoying!  

Needless to say the scene is awesome!  Hot dogs, burgers, pizza, rice bowls, and cajun burritos!  I guarantee you'll come back for more and to explore the different flavors!

"If there was a way I could give this restaurant NO stars, I might have.  The chips and salsa are the ONLY thing that requires a star here.

The service was less than average, the food was hotter than the surface of the sun, and the drinks were teeny tiny (and didn't much taste like alcohol).

"I went here with a party of 4 on Saturday night and it was surprisingly dead.  Not that that's a bad thing because I don't like crowds.  The place is pretty sheik but you still feel like you're in a hotel.  Service was fast and friendly but I think it was our waiter's first night or something.  He was very awkward but it was ok.

I was pissed we couldn't get the happy hour menu/prices in the main dining room.  I know it is common practice for crowded places full of douchebags, but the bar and the main dining room were pretty empty so wtf?

I'm a vodka guy and their vodka menu is pretty neat.  They have 8 or 9 unique vodkas from around the US and clearly list their name, where they are from and the price.  What I didn't like was their martinis.  Pretty much the worst I've ever had anywhere.  Tiny pours and full of ice chips.  It was like a vodka slushy (oh snap I think I just invented something!!!).

Here is a rundown of the food:

* bread to start - excellent...love the lightly buttered and salted top
* tomato and mozzarella salad - excellent - one of the best i've ever had.  great dressing and ample balls of fresh mozzarella.
* pretzel fondue - the pretzels were excellent but the fondue and mustard were no bueno.  the fondu was gritty and the mustard lacked the kick that I love on pretzels.
* burger - pretty solid but nothing special
* mac n' cheese with Shriner's sausage - very unique and very tasty.  it was worth having once but I wouldn't get it again.
* tater tots - perfectly cooked.  salty/crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  The only thing that would have made these better is some type of aioli or other special dipping sauce other than ketchup.

The main dishes of the other people in my party looked excellent.  I should have been more adventurous and gone with something more than a standard burger.  Maybe next time. 

I was going to give this place 3 stars but I just can't.  They try to think out of the box to create dishes that are unique, have fresh ingredients, and have a local twist.

Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, you've found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it!

I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldn't be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.  

This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. It's really *that* terrible.

"I want to like this place as it is in the neighborhood and there aren't many other options around here, but this is probably the worst restaurant/bar I've ever had the misfortune of going to. 

My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer, despite the bar being nearly empty, as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.  

I drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.  I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip... I just want out of here.  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well.

On other trips here my wife and I have had the food.  It's not any better than the service sadly.  I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.  Overall just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front.  Nobody's there because it's simply horrible.  Avoid at all cost.  I wouldn't eat here again, but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help.  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house.

"Wow. Wow Freakin' Wow.

I have never, ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you, learn your name, cater to your every need, and give you FABULOUS, beautifully prepared food since...well, NEVER. 

I must say I did do my research, so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place, I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish.

I went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York. She had been to Roy's before and is a fellow foodie. We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink. It's December so a bit chilly but the HUGE, soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka. Warning: We had to ask for more fruit juice! And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there.) Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones. I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture, some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine, enjoying the late afternoon, reading, conversing....well, if I HAD any rich or classy relatives, that is. It was very nice and relaxing. Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did.

When we meandered inside for dinner, the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table. She was very competent, could make recommendations, and was pleasant without being clingy. We loved her. She reminded me of Joan Cusack. Sounded just like her!

The complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced, steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them.

We shared the Roy's Canoe for Two, which had Lobster potstickers, Beef Satay, shrimp on a stick (not its real name), and Tuna Sushi Rolls. I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex. The Beef satay was basically this ultra-tender beef on a stick, lightly flavored and grilled. Fabulous. But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls, which absolutely knocked our socks off. I have never, ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment. I think our  server, Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it, my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy.  She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs-up sign. For whatever reason, these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine. I re-live that moment over and over. MMM.

But you know, the showstopper was STILL yet to come. I could not believe my luck when my Roy's Trio was placed in front of me. It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce, a piece of Seared Ahi, and a piece of salmon. The poor salmon! It was the best salmon I ever had out, but next to those two it was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister. Just upstaged by the butterfish, which is melt-in-your mouth decadence, and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER.

Amy got the butterfish. We licked our plates clean. Amy tried my Ahi and declared it, like I did, the BEST seared Ahi on the planet.

For dessert, you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle. How good was it?? Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face.

Amy ordered the 3 creme brulees - one had a Hawaiian orchid on it, and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing. The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like. I think the other flavors are vanilla bean (very good too) and maybe rum? (also very good) 

It may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when you've been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield, which one is better? They are both amazing, but by the time Rick comes along, well, you're kind of spoiled already.

Roy's could not have been better - this entire experience was an A++ through and through. 

The staff was extremely helpful (someone walked me to the ladies room when I merely asked where it was) (Oh and need I mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house???) (And you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxi-pads is out on the marble bathroom counter, like party favors for down under)

For starters, where the heck is this place? At first, I wasn't sure if I should be walking in simply because the factory workshop look threw me off!  Um ... hello?  No worries, once we walked into the store area that's when the fun started.  This place really got my interest.  Seems to me you can purchase some vintage items and clothes.  They had stadium-seating area with a projector screen, an ice cream shake area, boxing ring, and a small gym -- where the heck am I!   

We finally found the restaurant area shortly.  The kitchen is an old school food truck, then again everything about this place is old school; chairs, tables, etc.  I ordered the sliders because it was a recommendation - meatball, chicken sausage, and bbq brisket.  A bottle of coke -- yep it figures.  Meatball sliders were the best of the 3, the sausage was definitely and acquired taste.   My sis, had the eggs and avocado one and it was okay.

"I purchased the original Kindle Fire in 2011 and the second generation Kindle Fire in 2012. I gave my original one to my grandson and he is still using it for apps and reading. I liked both of them and I have to tell you that they have held up very well. One is over 3 years old and the other is 2 years old and I have not had any issues with them. Since I have not upgraded in 2 years I thought I would get a new one with a larger memory and a faster CPU and a higher resolution display. There are many improvements beyond even those features.I have to tell you that overall I am impressed with this new one. I didn't feel the need to purchase a Kindle Fire every year and when I purchased the next one I wanted it to be a definite upgrade step to what I had. I stayed with the 7 inch size as I like to portability and weight for long term reading. I alternate between the Kindle Paperwhite for reading in the daytime and at night sometimes and I use the Kindle Fire for reading in the evening and at night plus browsing the internet and getting email. This new Kindle Fire HD 2014 version is very fast and easy to use. Setting it up for the internet and downloading my apps and books was a breeze. I like the fact that the larger memory allows me to carry more apps and books. The higher resolution of the screen is helpful in reading books as the text is clearer and easier on my eyes than the older Kindle Fires we own. The screen is better for playing apps and watching videos and movies and it is worth the upgrade from the older Kindle Fires.I like that this version has both a front and rear facing camera.

"Imagine the scene on a Saturday morning in my house during college bowl season...

Husband pulls out jalapeno flavored Cheez Its (which is a totally different story in and of itself), to which I say ""oh, if you're hungry let's go grab something and then exchange Christmas gifts at the mall."" Husband looks at me like I have just committed a murder. I convince him that it's not really THAT far away from North Scottsdale and that it could be fun.

An hour later (with no traffic might I add), we arrive. I have to say that we both looked at each other with that ""this is it?!?!"" face, as I think we both envisioned something more like The Farm at South Mountain. Although the atmosphere isn't quite as quaint, QCOM is still pretty darn cool. We each ordered a soup (cream of tomato and cream of mushroom), which were pretty good. My husband had an Italian sandwich (the ""kalamata,"" I think), and I had a grilled vegetable panini. The food was filling and tasty, and it was really fun to eat outside and enjoy the crisp ""winter"" weather (if you can consider 50 degrees winter). 

We didn't take the tour since it seemed sort of silly (it just consisted of a short lecture outside and then a quick tour inside), but we did enjoy the samples set about the store....flavored pistachios, olives and tapenades. Overall, it was a very pleasant place to lunch, although it took us twice as long to drive there and back as we actually spent on the premises.

I guess we were supporting the local economy by visiting a local farm, etc....but the irony is that we wasted a whole lot of gas in our SUV in the process. Oh well.

"I couldn't rate this place until my 2nd go around only because my first time was take-out.  That being said, I did get the same thing both times and am pretty sure I can say I enjoy their Pulled Pork portion and would get it again.  It is moist, soft, and flavorful all on its own, but I do enjoy drizzling some Sissy sauce on it.  I've also had their corn-on-the-cob twice and found it super plain and not even sweet or enjoyable.. totally blah for me with the corn.  They use real butter, though, so if I liked their corn, I'd be a fan of that.  I'll stick to the pulled pork.

On to their BBQ sauce: I am not a big fan of a few things, mainly how they serve the sauce, which is in a large diameter *glass* bottle with a bottle pourer (the kind bartenders used to control the flow of alcohol when pouring)... no bueno. It took me a long while to get a quarter size sauce on to my pork and it was just frustrating.. and the glass makes it non-squeezable.. and the huge bottle makes it heavy to hold while you're waiting for gravity to help you get that little dab of sauce out and on to your meat... yeahhh, it was that annoying.  Here's an idea: make your sauce fresh and then put it in big ass jars than we can either portion out ourselves (like Joe's Real BBQ) or put it in squeezable bottles (like Famous Dave's)... *anything* but giant glass bottles with pourer restrictors on... puhleeeeze!

Their staff is very friendly, the ambiance is very relaxed and totally casual, pic-nic-style seating and, of course, country.  They have a great concept of huge coolers of booze (beer) where you can pick out your beer and put it in a bucket.. they also have sody-pop and sweet tea.

"The Good Egg is a breakfast spot I frequent on a regular basis. During the week it's hopping with folks on their lunch breaks and the weekend crowd seems to be most predominant during brunch hours.

The menu offers a wide variety of items to choose from. They are only open for breakfast and lunch, but you can order any of them at any time during business hours. Pancakes of a mammoth proportion are often seen zooming by on the arm of a server. Instead of hashbrowns, homestyle fried potatoes are served on the side of most dishes.

The serving staff have always been very friendly and accommodating and it makes the experience a very pleasant one every time I am there. The patio is very large and can seat many. This is especially nice during sunny days, but not so much on a cold January morning even with the large heaters operating.

If you go on a weekend morning, prepare for a bit of a wait. You can sip complimentary coffee outside while waiting for your party to be called.

I like the sense of accomplishment you get from eating a cupcake. You may have had a hard day, but you finished an entire cupcake. That's validation. It makes me happy.

Sprinkles is a great place to go for a sugar fix, but I have to say there are some negatives. I have had a dry cupcake there. They are a bit on the expensive side.

The worst sin of all? Their red velvet is ""a southern style light chocolate cake with a cream cheese frosting"". I have to disagree. I don't detect any cream cheese flavor in that frosting.

The first time I devoured a Sprinkles cupcake it was magical. I was particularly impressed with the black and white- ""Belgian dark chocolate with creamy vanilla frosting"". I was in a shoebox Los Angeles apartment and the cupcakes seemed of adequate size. The next time was the new location  am currently reviewing and they were consumed in a larger-than-shoebox Chandler house. They seemed a little small. The third time was in my car- a Subaru Baja, and the cupcakes, again seemed sizable. I'd have to think that consuming a Sprinkles cupcake in an SUV would not be a great idea- the cupcake to eating space ratio would be all off. 


For true cupcake validation, I'll drive the 35.9 miles to Wicked.

Ok- you caught me. I might stop by for an emergency fix if I happen to be in the area, but I'll be thinking of Slade at Wicked... and I'll be consuming my confection in a small space.",honestli love cupcak like said wick bakeri review eat cupcak unlik slice cake give sens accomplish like cupcak like sens accomplish get eat cupcak may hard day finish entir cupcak valid make happi sprinkl great place go sugar fix say neg dri cupcak bit expens side worst sin red velvet southern style light chocol cake cream chees frost disagre detect cream chees flavor frost first devour sprinkl cupcak magic particularli impress black white belgian dark chocol creami vanilla frost shoebox lo angel apart cupcak seem adequ size next new locat current review consum larger shoebox chandler hous seem littl small third car subaru baja cupcak seem sizabl think consum sprinkl cupcak suv would great idea cupcak eat space ratio would true cupcak valid drive mile wick ok caught might stop emerg fix happen area think slade wick consum confect small space,1

My stylist, Delia, ran 45 minutes late to start me, and on several occasions during the hair cut, stopped and kept looking around.  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.  She not only didn't listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldn't look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didn't ask for.  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store, after which I waited in, they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.

The tomatoes were mealy. The whole thing was sad. The chicken stew was decent, but had that plastic -y look to it. I always find that a little disturbing. It came with a biscuit that was really gross and didn't go with the stew at all. Both of our cookies were raw in the middle. Plus the meal cost 20$. Really?! 20$?!?! Are they kidding me?

We were the first people in the bar, which was a little awkward at first but kind of nice, since we had a fancy, chic space all to ourselves! We all enjoyed our drinks, including my husband's and my dirty martinis. My only gripe was that they didn't come with the blue cheese olives mentioned on the menu already in them. Instead, the server brought them to our table and then asked if we wanted the olives.

"I bought this tablet for its size, economical price point, and the ability to watch content offline. And it offers exactly that...but falls short on performance parameters. If you're price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet, large screen, and the ability to watch content offline, this is a great device to get. However, if you already have an earlier Kindle like the HDX 8.9 or even an earlier version of the Fire, I recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn't really be a worthwhile upgrade. I have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device.The- constant freezing of the device,- slow speed to load apps,- significant lags when switching apps that only become worse as you load more stuff on the tablet,- erratic wifi connection that drops often and the ensuing trouble to connect back to the same network, and- the frequent need to reboot the device,all factors made this a frustrating device to own . The HDX is far better in every aspect, heck even the original Fire 7 runs better than this device.The only good things about this device are the screen size and the MicroSD slot. So if you're only watching videos on this, and would like to have the option of watching content offline when you're traveling, this tablet would be just fine. Otherwise, the HDX is still a better option, or you could get the 7 or 8 Fire models. Those are priced cheaper and work better.Original review is below---For the price point and size alone, the Fire HD 10 would seem like a good deal. For its performance, however, it falls short of expectations. I would probably rate it a 3.5 overall. If it wasn't for the price, the rating would have been even lower.Read more",bought size econom price point abil watch content offlin offer exactli fall short perform paramet price sensit look valu larg screen abil watch content offlin great get howev alreadi earlier kindl like hdx even earlier version fire recommend keep sinc realli worthwhil upgrad disappoint sever oper shortcom constant freez slow speed load app signific lag switch app becom wors load stuff errat wifi connect drop often ensu troubl connect back network frequent need reboot factor made frustrat hdx far better everi aspect heck even origin fire run better good thing screen size microsd slot watch video would like option watch content offlin travel would fine otherwis hdx still better option could get fire model price cheaper work better origin review price point size alon fire hd would seem like good deal perform howev fall short expect would probabl rate overal price rate would even lower,0

"Hard to miss with a Centurion guarding the entrance.  

I wished it was nice patio weather.  The place was very cozy and a little uncomfortable padded banko seating.  If the tables were only several inches higher, it would have been better!  

First off, we ordered Baked Brie and Raspberry  wrapped in puff pastry hors d'oeuvres with a side of grapes.  A couple of glasses of light and fruity red Portugal wines paired well. 

""Can I have some lemonade?"", nope, no lemonade.  ""How about Sprite?"", sorry, no Sprite.  So sad to see the look on cutie pie's face.  Even wine bars would have had something for him to drink.  ""Okay, water is fine.""  He gloomly said.  We promised him an Italian soda next door at Lola's.  He cheered up.

Killer pizzas, so I've heard.  We decided to order the Mozarella, basil (pesto instead), white truffle oil pizza.  The crust is amazingly toasty outside and soft and flaky inside.  Good 14"" inches for $12 pie!   We added Risotto with manchego cheese/chorizo.  It was very, very, very rich!  It was so rich, I wanted to reach for some bread to sop it up!

We were so full and carbo-ed up!  We didn't balance out our meals very well.   Good thing we took the lightrail downtown.  We needed to do a lot of walking after all that eating!

The place was packed on a Saturday night at 5pm, which is a good indication one is in for a treat.  We made a reservation just in case, since we were going to see a show later that night.  Our waiter greeted us quickly and was very friendly and upbeat.  He told us the specials and took our drink order while we looked over the huge menu.

In the end we got the lobster roll appetizer, halibut, and bread pudding for dessert.  Everything was soooo... good and very filling.  The lobster appetizer was full of flavor, especially the sauce it came with.  The halibut was cooked perfectly and the grits on the side were amazing.  We loved the bread pudding, which was HUGE for the price.  I wish there weren't as many raisins, but all in all it was great.

"Hands down, the single worst public mass transit system I have seen ANY PLACE I have ever lived or traveled to (and I am an avid world traveler).

This is a joke compared to other cities in the USA (and abroad) that have equivalent populations. Hell, in NYC and LA, it's SOOO much easier to get around even though those places are larger and more densely populated.

Always way too early without waiting, or way too late without apology), more stops, stops that have actual BENCHES or SHADE or POSTED INFORMATION of any kind.

"I love Chez Nous for the dancing, the live music is always great, but this past Friday I was really disappointed.  The cover charge has been raised to $7, the drinks were weak, and I got charged $9 for a Three Olives and Coke.  Combine that with being cash only so getting hit for $3 at the ATM inside the bar, and after one poor drink I was already at $20.  Maybe it's because I've gone back to being a broke college student, but I found the whole experience disappointing.

"Oooh!  A shiny new pizza spot!  I have been told time and time again to try Barro's, so the opening of this location was the perfect opportunity to put it to my pepperoni and mushroom test.  All I can say is What Took Me So Long!?  This pizza is GOOD!  Zesty sauce, ample topping coverage and a puffy pillow-like outer crust.  It looks like it would be chewy, but it is not.  How do they do that?  Some sort of pizza alchemy, I am sure.

This location is brand new.  The dark wood floors and high-backed booths (that don't yet have butt-indentations from previous guests) are not the typical plastic red/green/white decor what you would expect from a casual pizza restaurant.  The staff is friendly, both on the phone and in person, which is nice.  

In addition to fantastic whole pies, they also have inexpensive lunch specials (2 slices and a soda for $4 is my favorite!) until 4pm every day.

My only small sadness is that this location does not deliver to my house (even though it is closer than the Barro's that does cover my delivery area).

"You know how you poke fun at people who go to a steakhouse and they order something like chicken or seafood? I'm one of those people, but this time I teamed my seafood with STEAK!

They had a prix fixe menu that carried over from their New Year's Eve dinner, but I skipped over that...

I have to say, I loved my sirloin and 5 pieces of shrimp. Shrimp was done correctly - not rubbery or charred and *gasp* it was actually de-veined. I can't tell you how I've gone to nicer restaurants and their shrimp wasn't de-veined. So that alone got a little happy dance from me.

Food was a bit on the salty side, but it didn't make me have a massive thirst craving when we left the restaurant. Server was friendly and knowledgeable, which was great!

Hubby ordered his prime rib, but they didn't have it blue which was the way he wanted it. It's all good, they still brought him out some of the rarest prime rib I've seen in a long time...

For an appetizer we ordered bacon wrapped scallops. I am a firm believer of 'bacon makes everything good!' and it did. The sauce that came with the dish was delicate and flavorful. The fresh rolls that came minutes before the entree was served were my favorite kind - light and fluffy on the inside while the outer layer had enough crunch that satisfied me, yet didn't make me feel like I was about to chip any teeth. ;)

"""Tanked Fish"" is one of my favorite places in the neighborhood and we frequent it often. 

Rolls are of a great quality and there are some rather unusual and pleasantly different ones there. Price is very reasonable. And drinks selection, if not overly excessive, is ""Cool"".  Place is not riddled with kids, like many other places are, and you can actually kick back and have a conversation there.
One one of the weekday evenings they have this special thing where you can request your musical choice from this rather large list. Its real neat. What else is neat - their happy hour on Wednesday (I am not sure what day exactly to be honest. Call them if you really want to know.), when drinks, starters and most rolls are 1/2! This really makes a huge difference. 

I gave this place 4 starts. This is pretty much as high as it goes for me for this.

Nails sanded too thin and they talk to other people and look away while they'e filing, sanding and cutting.

We went in on Sunday the 29th of July around 5:00pm. The guy behind the counter told us to enjoy ourselves, take our time, ask if we had any questions. We wandered around for a bit, I found a bottle of Argyle bubbly that I wanted, and then began to stare with lust in my eyes at the selection of Absinthe. 

Girlfriend wandered over to ask the guy to recommend a white that wasn't a Chard as we both really don't like buttery oak anything. He took a few cues from her, and found a great bottle of white which we drank with great glee last night. 

This was a test for the guy behind the counter. She didn't set a price limit, just said ""show me your favorite."" He could have done what many others have in the past and shown us a $50 bottle, but instead he showed us a kick ass bottle at the $14 price point. This is the mark of a good wine seller. Find you what you want without bending you over on the price. Yes, sometimes I want to spend $400 a bottle, but not all that often. I'd rather get my drink on at the price he found, and he turned us onto a white we both REALLY liked, which is super rare as we have very different tastes.

We'll absolutely be going back to buy more fermented grape from this place!

"I cannot speak for the food, (though the menu looked unique and tantalizing), but the beer selection was great, as was service. We arrived on Saturday night, the first weekend Angels Trumpet was open, around 10 p.m. for drinks. There was a large group of us, 9 people... though there weren't any tables to accomodate our party we were able to stand/be seated comfortably around one of the high-tops.

This place is great for smaller parties who enjoy a good beer. The selection cannot be beat in downtown Phoenix -- 31 craft brews on tap of every taste and style... and they're always rotating. I had the Biere Blonde & White... 4.5% alcohol, light, sunny taste. Reminded me of Four Peak's SunBrew.

The selection ranges from hoppy IPAs at 10% alcohol/volume to the lighter, summer brews and everything in between. There is literally something for everyone, even a few wines on tap for the non-beer drinkers.

Our server was very nice and accommodating.. and though the place was packed she got us our drinks pretty quickly.

A couple reasons I didn't give Angels Trumpet the perfect '5' star rating:

Disorganization-- Seating was sort of a nightmare... and we kind of waited around for one of the high-tops to open up and just snagged it.
Ambience-- I enjoyed the nice, open floor plan but the restaurant-style and dozens of tables/chairs was a bit puzzling considering the kitchen was closed when we arrived. I couldn't hear any music above the conversations in the room and the huge, 60"" TV screens weren't turned on. It'd be nice for weekend nights to boast something a little more special. If you're going to close the kitchen, allow people to walk around and mingle more.

Overall, if you're looking for a nice place to kick back with a small group of friends and try some awesome, unique beers on tap, Angels Trumpet is it. Their prices are reasonable for the quality offered.

I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this new generation was released before I spent my money. I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new tablet. It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text.I have added a video of the Kindle Paperwhite compared to a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I will try to answer them.I love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear. I use the Kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books. Reading was my number one hobby my entire life and I just loved it. The Kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen I can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. I laid my Kindle Keyboard and the New Kindle Paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new Paperwhite. The new lighting system and screen clarity is where this Paperwhite design really is outstanding. With better contrast, lighting and custom designed fonts, the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-Reader before. With 221 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) this screen provides a 768 by 1024 pixel screen that just makes the old Kindle Keyboard look old fashioned. Technology certainly does move quickly on.Read more",love use kindl keyboard year miss abl room low light dark purchas kindl fire also ipad eas read eye prefer kindl keyboard want get kindl paperwhit e reader held new gener releas spent money got want reduc eyestrain read even love new offer perfect balanc lit screen reduc eyestrain high clariti contrast text ad video kindl paperwhit compar kindl keyboard kindl fire question pleas feel free contact tri answer love text screen crisp clear kindl declin vision caus stop read book read number hobbi entir life love kindl brought back read experi crisper text lit screen enjoy read everi type environ laid kindl keyboard new kindl paperwhit side side comparison qualiti text clariti amazingli favor new paperwhit new light system screen clariti paperwhit design realli outstand better contrast light custom design font text pop screen like seen e reader ppi pixel per inch screen provid pixel screen make old kindl keyboard look old fashion technolog certainli move quickli,0

"OK, so I haven't been to a buffet in a long time.  When I reflect on the idea of buffets -- Sweet Tomatoes excluded, since lots of salad means lots of Good-For-You-ness, right?... --  I feel like I used up my lifetime maximum instances of buffet-eating in college, where the dining halls were all-you-can eat.  Anyway, this place just opened and is within walking distance of where I live, so my neighbors and I decided to check it out.  

Overall I wasn't very impressed with the food, even in comparison to other Chinese food buffets I've been to in the past.  In addition to a standard selection of Chinese buffet items (beef with broccoli, fried rice, sweet and sour chicken) they have sushi, pizza (for kids, I'm assuming), and a hibachi grill section where you can pick vegetables and meats and they'll stir fry it for you (included in the buffet price).  The hibachi stir fry I made up was OK, but the sauce added to it was too salty for me.  The sushi was bland and what you would expect from a grocery store.  They only had regular high-sodium soy sauce, as far as I could tell.  (I tried asking one of the wait staff for low-sodium soy sauce and there was a language barrier; he brought back another staff member to our table, who also didn't understand what I was asking.)  The egg roll I tried was really salty (even without sauce) and nothing to write home about.  Usually sweet & sour sauce can make even mediocre egg rolls worth eating, but the S&S sauce on the buffet was a downright-scary Kool-Aid-red color.  However, the fresh pineapple and melon was a nice touch, as were the 8 different ice cream flavors on the far end of the line.

I will say it was pretty cheap at $10 per adult, so if you're looking for a lot of food on a budget, it might be a decent option for you.  Personally though, I just think I am past the days of eating foods with scary salt levels, artificial colors, etc., so I won't plan on going back (though if I had to return for some reason, there are enough edible options so that I wouldn't starve).",ok buffet long reflect idea buffet sweet tomato exclud sinc lot salad mean lot good ness right feel like use lifetim maximum instanc buffet eat colleg dine hall eat anyway place open within walk distanc live neighbor decid check overal impress food even comparison chines food buffet past addit standard select chines buffet beef broccoli fri rice sweet sour chicken sushi pizza kid assum hibachi grill section pick veget meat stir fri includ buffet price hibachi stir fri made ok sauc ad salti sushi bland would expect groceri store regular high sodium soy sauc far could tell tri ask wait staff low sodium soy sauc languag barrier brought back anoth staff member tabl also understand ask egg roll tri realli salti even without sauc noth write home usual sweet sour sauc make even mediocr egg roll worth eat sauc buffet downright scari kool aid red color howev fresh pineappl melon nice touch differ ice cream flavor far end line say pretti cheap per adult look lot food budget might decent option person though think past day eat food scari salt level artifici color etc plan go back though return reason enough edibl option starv,0

"Where do I begin? 

Let's start with the server who literally yelled everything he asked or said to us. Oh, and then he rammed a chair into my leg and was just not very concerned about our experience overall.

Let's move on to the cheese crisp, which had plenty of grease cascading off the pieces, and virtually no ""crisp."" Did you put some cheese on a tortilla and microwave it? 'Cause I could have done that at home.

Both drinks were quite tasty- my tea was strong like I like it, but not bitter. Hubby's lemonade was very good, but he drank it so fast I didn't get a chance to steal many sips.

Let's discuss the entrees, shall we? Hubby's carne adovada chimi was decent, better than my carnitas. In fact, MY carnitas is better. (I keep aiming for Chef Hector's at Sam's...) Yes, the pork was very tender, but the salt was -shall I put it nicely?- aggressive. Sam Kinneson aggressive. The ""tortilla"" was an inedible science experiment. Thick and doughy, and made even more appetizing by the charred side, it reminded me of the salt play dough we all made as kids, formed into a pancake. Truly nasty.

As for the legendary salsas, Hubby found the green to be tasty, but he did not care for the flavor of the red. Neither was especially fiery to him either.

"I know my 2 girlfriends that absolutely LOVE this place will balk at my 4 stars instead of 5. But honestly, I think this place is slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think 4 stars is just right for the rating. 

We went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a ""valet"" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no I'm not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes). We sat outside, which wasn't ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK. 

Sadly we didn't make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I don't know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent. 

We ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about). 

For dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didn't have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto. 

And honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini). 

And hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $5 a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it 5 stars.

"I live down the street from Casey Moore's. I have been here a total of three times. The first time a group of us just ordered drinks, and the margaritas my friend and I ordered were so terrible that we sent them back. The second time I went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich. Again, it was so awful I had to send it back. I am not a picky eater, nor have I been known to complain about food or service when dining out. There has only been one other restaurant I have ever been to where I sent food back. So, this place was already two for two. Alas, my husband begged me to go back once more. He was craving oysters and since this is an oyster house, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give them one more shot. It was last Thursday evening, and the place was hoppin'. This time, the food was decent. Not good, but decent enough where I may have given Casey Moore's a fourth chance had I been impressed with the service. But the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress got us our drinks and didn't come back to take our orders for another 20 minutes. We sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop by, and though she passed us quickly several times, she never even acknowledged us with a simple ""I'll be back with your orders."" When she did arrive 20 minutes later, she asked if we were ready to order without even an apology. I am not kidding you when I say she acted like she wanted nothing to do with us. She was very monotone and never smiled with us. I would like to pass this off as her having a bad night, but when she went to her other tables (all full of men with drinks) she suddenly lit up, laughed, and had a blast with them. It was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past. But no. This was our first time meeting her. We were pleasant customers who didn't complain about the mediocre food or slow service. We were polite and left a good tip. We pride ourselves on being fun, engaging, and polite with our servers since we go out often. But let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry.

She was totally spot-on.

These delicious hand-made tortillas are fantastic!  I wish I could take a bunch back to Seattle with me, but since they're freshly-made, I'm guessing the lack of preservatives will make that a better idea than reality.

"I had very high hopes for this place, after the very good reviews Fate got and that Sens has been getting, but I was terribly disappointed. The mango papaya spring rolls were dominated by the flavor of anise/licorice. The shu mai dumplings were so hard, even hard-core Italians would have said they were too al dente. The black dragon chicken was good, but not great. After we left, we noticed the dinner menu was much more extensive, especially without the tapas. Maybe dinner here is a much better experience, but I'm not sure I'd even be willing to give it a try after the lunch I had here. As for the atmosphere and decor - don't even get me started. Talk about trying too hard to be hip. The Vegas-y blue lighting in the bar area, the Northwest coffehouse style old-looking couch in the back, the Asian influence...I'm not a proponent of ""matchy-matchy"" decor, but this was all over the place.

I finally got the chance to stop by yesterday. They've been open about a week now. They are located on the north west corner of Guadalupe & McClintock, between the pet food store and Panda Express. 

Super cute place, has a roll up/fold up door so the whole front of the building can be open, right onto their little patio. You can sit inside or outside! 

Tons of different flavors! I tried the Peanut Butter & Jelly & a mint/chocolate one. Both were very tasty. I ended up going with their chocolate yogurt with some peanut butter sauce, a Giradelli chocolate sauce and peanut butter cups. SO GOOD. A decent sized cup cost about $3.30. 

The girl who rang me up was super nice, and offered me up little sample cups. 

The only suggestion I have is to label the toppings. Yes, most all of them are self-explantory, but a lot of those candy bars look the same all chopped up!

I had to call them about replacing the cover thrice, they finally did, and then I found out that there was a HUGE air leak in the corner. They never fixed the interior trim.

They sent out the same first idiots to plug the leak, and they ended up breaking a ton of clips for a covering on my car, ruining the windshield wiper covers, and DOUSING my tweeter in water. I called immediately after they left and got harassed by a ""manager"" because he just had hip surgery (why is this my fault?!) and couldnt come until a week out!

"My dad and I decided to try Great Wall because he had heard many reviews about the place and everyone insisted that you had to come try the Dim Sum.  Since I was in town visiting, it gave us the perfect excuse to go.

I'm happy to report that the experience was most excellent at Great Wall and that it lived up to the hype.  Upon getting there, we were given a number to wait as the restaurant was completely full, there were probably 150+ people there dining, however, we were seated within 15 minutes.  As soon as we  sat down, the carts started rolling by with various plates of items to try.

The pancake, shu mai, shrimp, duck, and sliced beef inside a wrapper are highly recommended, all were excellent.  I did have a bit of trouble taking the shrimp out of the steam container because their rice wrappers were sticking a bit, but that does happen.

I would advise that if you have an allergy to shrimp that you make sure to ask the server what is in some of the items because they do come with shrimp, including their egg rolls.  Since my dad has a shrimp allergy we did have to watch for that.  I did want to try their egg rolls but I would have been the only one eating them, and they were big enough to make a meal in itself.

The sliced duck was one of the best I have had at a restaurant, well cooked with crispy tasty skin, and not too many bones to get in the way, and very reasonably priced at $6.25 for a plate.  Most other Dim Sum plates are $2.25 or $3.15 so you can end up eating a lot for a very reasonable price.

If you love Dim Sum and are willing to wait a few minutes for a table, but you will get fast service afterward, this really is the place you want to go to.  There are still so many more dishes to try as well, but that will be for another trip.",dad decid tri great wall heard mani review place everyon insist come tri dim sum sinc town visit gave us perfect excus go happi report experi excel great wall live hype upon get given number wait restaur complet full probabl peopl dine howev seat within minut soon sat cart start roll variou plate tri pancak shu mai shrimp duck slice beef insid wrapper highli recommend excel bit troubl take shrimp steam contain rice wrapper stick bit happen would advis allergi shrimp make sure ask server come shrimp includ egg roll sinc dad shrimp allergi watch want tri egg roll would eat big enough make meal slice duck best restaur well cook crispi tasti skin mani bone get way reason price plate dim sum plate end eat lot reason price love dim sum will wait minut tabl get fast servic afterward realli place want go still mani dish tri well anoth trip,0

"Well after using it last night and sleeping on it, (the experience... didn't actually sleep on my Fire TV) I had been debating between 4 and 5 stars. I am a longtime media streamer. I have 7 Rokus and have bought 3 more as gifts to family. I also have a Chromcast and an Xbox 360. Additionally I have tried various other streaming devices such as Netgear NeoTV, the D-Link MovieNite etc.(I am still trying to figure out why I bought the Chromecast the least useful gadget I have ever owned. )First of all the Fire TV is everything that Amazon claims it is. It is fast. It is sleek. The interface is handsome and of course very Kindle Fire like.After hooking it up it immediately downloaded updates. ( An annoying process that almost every new computing device does whether it is a phone, tablet, streamer, or computer. It seems to take forever but it is really not that long, it is just that we are in Christmas Morning opening presents mode and time slows down when you are excited about trying something new. -) )I give it 5 stars because Amazon delivered what it said it would. I doubt it will replace anyone's existing favorite. I would recommend it to anyone just entering the streaming media game and who has kids and Amazon Prime. It is a fantastic portal to Amazon products.Many people have tried to compare it to Roku, Apple, Chromecast etc but to me I compare it to my XBox. It plays Video, Music and Games so for some, who want to have a less expensive alternative to an XBox One, there it is. (Of course you cannot compare it XBox One or PS4 but not everyone wants to shell out 50 - 60 dollars for a game or 400-500 for a game console. This is plenty for the casual gamer or kids.)Being on the Android platform will allow the number of apps to increase exponentially and for watching Amazon's videos (Prime and Pay) it is perfect.About the experience....For Amazon's offerings it is the best out there. I highly recommend Amazon Prime as it is comparable to Netflix plus I have saved a bundle on free shipping. The interface for the movies is first class. The remote's FF and RW buttons also act as skip forward and skip back buttons. Press RW once to jump back 10 seconds or hold to rewind. Same for the FF button. The interface for Amazon video is similar to the new one for Netflix on Roku 3 with the entire screens background feature the highlight movie. Surprising the interface for Netflix on Fire TV is the older one not the new one.The Plex app works fine for all my DLNA needs. (playing media from my home computers)Wish list.1. Allow us to change the position of Apps. When you start adding apps the latest one is the first one on the list, so add them in reverse order to get your most frequently used ones at the top of the list. There is a row of tiles for Recently Watched that allow you remove from that list but it is kludgey. Those of you who have a kindle fire will recognize the system. Or add a quick Access or Favorites row of tiles at the top of the Home Screen.2. Would love to have Amazon tie into the Ultraviolet system. I have close to 200 movies there. You can reach it through the Flixster app but HD is not available on the Flixster app.3. HBOGo4. Vudu5. HBOGo6. Vudu7. HBOGo8.

"Living in this area I frequent Desert Ridge a lot, and have been to this Macaroni Grill several times... their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times... My friend and I have had experiences such as standing at the host stand with no assistance for several minutes while several employees made eye contact. Of course, no one asked if we had been helped, until the hostess finally made her way back up to the stand and decided to ignore us for another couple of seconds before she even acknowledged us. 

Another visit we were seated right away however it took over 15 minutes for our server to come to our table, and that was only after I had to get out of my seat and find one of the employees to ask for our server. I know several people saw us just sitting there, the least they could have done was asked if we had been helped or not. 

This last experience, was about a year after the last. I thought maybe they would have changed. I most definitely thought wrong! We were seated promptly and the server was there right away this time. However, our food took FOREVER! Literally, it took over 30 minutes for a medium rare steak and a plate of pasta. I know for a fact they messed something up and ended up taking food out of a to go container and placing it on the plate that they then brought to me (you can see right into their kitchen from the dining room).

"It had been a few years since I last gave this place a try. It hadn't blown me away as I had remembered, but I was still up to giving it another shot.  I must say that this place is much better than I had remembered. I stopped in for lunch and there were several people eating in there at the time. I ordered the Luncheon Special #3 (Cashew Chicken served with an egg roll, fried wonton, fried rice, and a fortune cookie) for myself and a #1 special (Qwik special chicken which also came with all the additional stuff mentioned above) for a friend to go.  Each dish was only $6.25 a piece and were both ready in about 7 minutes. I guess the Qwik part wasn't just a clever name, they actually do cook stuff up pretty fast there.  I brought the food back to the office and tried my lunch. Yes, I also made sure to give my friend his lunch as well.  It was a dark meat chicken, white meat can be substituted, in your typical brown sauce with veggies and cashews. However it was done well. No one ingredient dominated the dish and there wasn't a ton of sauce. The egg roll was crispy and flaky and filled with veggie goodness as well. I like the fact that they will deliver as far south as Camelback, north to Cactus, east to 60th street, and west to 96th. They are open until 9:30 pm seven days a week which is nice as well. I went back to try some of the soups and the dumplings and I have to say that while the soup was good, the dumplings may just be in the top 3 that I have had in Arizona. They don't have that ""just unfrozen"" taste that many restaurants have.

"Lee Lee's finally expanded from their Chandler location for us who have loyally driven an hour to shop. Low prices, huge selection, and it only took like a week for the place to smell like a true Asian market (i.e., wherever you are, you will never escape the smell of fish).

I love it. I bought ingredients for Vietnamese spring rolls, two different kinds of curries, a new motor/pestle, a Vietnamese coffee press, and some various other vegetables and liquors... hardly anything. Also, the seafood, while I didn't purchase any, looks very fresh.

"I found myself in Phoenix for a week. I prefer Marriott, but a co-worker insisted on Hilton....and then didn't go on the trip. Nice.

Anyway, the stay was a hodgepodge of experiences. 

Downsides: The room was nondescript on the whole, but the neck of the shower was pulled partly out of the wall and the shower curtain was partly torn and had red (?!?) mold on it. I didn't have a car, so the parking lot didn't bother me, but the area on one side of the hotel was sketchy and had a fair amount of undesirable foot traffic. The nearest station to get on the light rail was 3 blocks either way from the hotel.

Upsides: The staff was friendly and super-helpful in recommending EXCELLENT restaurants, including hole-in-wall, genuine Mexican joints. The hotel has a shuttle van that will, if you reserve it or can snag a ridealong, take you anywhere within five miles of the hotel for free, and then pick you up again. Naturally you should tip the driver (also a great guy), but it still beats taking a cab. The driver gets bonus points for letting us jump out and grab a coffee on the way to our destination! It also is only 1.5 blocks from Fez, a fantastic restaurant. 

I was not knocked out by the facility, but the people were great.

"The place has a nice little vibe going on and they have some unique items but the reason the rating is so low is that there really aren't a lot of options that don't involve faux meat.  Aren't these people vegan?  Don't they hate the idea of poor little animals being our food (even though that is the only reason they are alive)?  Then why so much FAKE MEAT?!  

I will never understand the meat envy vegans and vegetarians have.  I go to a place like this to get a dish that uses vegetables in more creative ways, not to get some overly processed soy products that aren't nearly as healthy as fresh lean meats like chicken and fish.  FYI, I love meat but every once in a while I like to grab a vegetarian dish.  

Another negative is nearly everything is fried.  Guess they bust the myth that people are vegan because it is healthier.  Frying things is the cheap way out of actually creating a healthy AND tasty meal.  

I'll give them a 2.5 star because what we chose was quite tasty.  But with nearly every option involving faux meat and tofu it really is a disappointment.  If you want legitimate vegan fare try out some indian places or Ethiopian places.  They are very creative and using spices to flavor a vegetable dish. The fake cheeses and meats are for Vegans with meat envy, not for Omnivores that just want a good meal.  Keep your expectations in check and you should be okay.",place nice littl vibe go uniqu reason rate low realli lot option involv faux meat peopl vegan hate idea poor littl anim food even though reason aliv much fake meat never understand meat envi vegan vegetarian go place like get dish use veget creativ way get overli process soy product nearli healthi fresh lean meat like chicken fish fyi love meat everi like grab vegetarian dish anoth neg nearli everyth fri guess bust myth peopl vegan healthier fri thing cheap way actual creat healthi tasti meal give star chose quit tasti nearli everi option involv faux meat tofu realli disappoint want legitim vegan fare tri indian place ethiopian place creativ use spice flavor veget dish fake chees meat vegan meat envi omnivor want good meal keep expect check okay,0
"This place used to be amazing.  My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents.  It's not the same anymore.

We went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.

We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.

The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.

While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.

So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.

"The Fire HD 7 is a great entry-level Fire Tablet that includes a 7 1200x800 216 ppi pixel density display. Pixel density wise, this is the lowest off all the Fire Tablets but is still decent enough where you're going to get a nice picture on the display. It's by no means an iPad killer or Galaxy Tab killer and you really shouldn't purchase it for that purpose. This particular model is really tailored to reading Kindle books, streaming video, browsing the web, checking email, and so forth. Bottom line, It's a great deal at 139. I'm going to compare the features of the HD 7 with the features of the other Fire Tablets to help you make an informed decision on which model to go with:*** DISPLAY ***The display is a 7 1200x800 resolution display with a 216 ppi pixel density which is not great, but not horrible either. It is the lowest pixel density of all the Fire Tablets with the Fire HD 6 coming in at 252 ppi, the Fire HDX coming in at 323 ppi, and the Fire HDX 8.9 coming in at 339 ppi. The human eye really can't distinguish individual pixels beyond a density of about 300 ppi so you're not going to be getting a noticeably pixelated display by any means. All in all, this is a nice display.*** PROCESSOR, GPU, AND ON-BOARD STORAGE ***The Fire HD 7 comes with a respectable 1.5 GHz quad-core processor with enough power to run almost all of your content with ease, including smooth video playback. It comes with a mediocre 1 GB of RAM which really is not sufficient in my opinion but it is what it is.

"This was my first time visiting Tandoori Times.  After seeing it advertised on Groupon, I thought I'd give it a try.  My friend and I decided to go for lunch to celebrate her birthday.  It was very busy, which was promising.  The waitress was on her second day working there and was unfamiliar with the menu, but she was friendly.  

The house salad was mediocre, the entree (Algoo Gobi) was delicious, but the desserts were AWFUL.  The ""mango"" ice cream was a neon orange and tasted nothing like mango, or any flavor of ice cream Id ever tasted actually (kinda vanilla, kinda puke).  YUCK.  The rice pudding was not worth eating either.  

The worst part of the experience was being followed out into the parking lot, after leaving the Groupon and cash tip, to be told that we needed to come speak with management about not ordering at least $40 worth of food!  Really?  I told the waiter that we had spent just over $30, and we obviously didn't expect any cash back from the $40 Groupon.  He said his manager was ""fussy"" and wouldn't like it.  I basically told him that was too damn bad, and that I wasn't ordering $10 more in food; I was actually kinda saving them $10! 

He finally figured out what I was saying and left us alone.  I did end up calling the manager though, who was not pleased to hear about our experience with the dumb waiter.

"Matt's was absolutely fantastic. Got there at 2pm on a Sunday, which is apparently the time to do it (half an hour before close), as we walked right in, sat right down, and had food in 5 minutes or less. Brilliant.

I had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had. Two eggs, two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon, american cheese (my favorite with eggs when I'm not going fancy-style, reminds me of when I was a kid), and well grilled onions round it out, served on a fantastic roll. 

By default, this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldn't finish them.

The girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matt's brings the good stuff, and it's MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor.

I can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience. Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21. Absolutely worth every penny. Will be coming back.

"I don't quite get it. Am I naive, not part of the ""in"" crowd or not tipping the right people? Our experience at Masto's started off a little rocky, but wound up being okay. 

We arrived 15 minutes early for our 6:00 PM reservation Sunday evening, no problem because the place is dead, right? Not so fast! We get taken to the worst table in the farthest corner of the restaurant while passing by 80% of the tables that are empty. Luckily we noticed right away the table would be a good fit for 12 people not a party of two which we were. They graciously reseated us at a small table for two which was much better.

Now, after that you may think, why'd this guy give them four stars. Well they redeemed themselves a little later. My partner ordered an ice tea which they were temporarily out of. How does that happen by the way? Out of Ice Tea? But I digress, they wound up bringing him a complimentary Ice Tea once they had brewed a new batch.

I guess you probably want to know about the food. I started with the Beefsteak Tomato and Onion appetizer which was excellent, my partner loved his loved his French Onion Soup. We both had the Bone-In Kansas City Strip his was a little undercooked and mine was just perfect. We shared the Au Gratin Potatoes and Creamed Spinach...both were excellent.

"I recently tried vietnamese food, maybe 3 years ago.  I especially like the pho soup and spring rolls.  Since then, I have been trying every place I can that serves pho.  Out of every place that I have been so far, this place is always the one I come back to.  It's a little hole in the wall type place.  The kind you would drive by and never even notice if you weren't looking for it.  The pho has some of the best tasting broth and is a good portion.  It's about average price if not closer to the cheapest I have found.  It comes with a good sized plate of sprouts, basil, mint, lime, and jalapeno.  The spring rolls that I get have pork and shrimp in them and are a pretty good size.  The peanut sauce that comes with them for dipping tastes almost like fresh made peanut butter and has fresh ground pieces of peanut in it.  The service is fairly quick and very friendly, even with the fact that there is some language barrier.  I was actually taken to this place for the first time by an ex-coworker of mine who is an old vietnamese guy.

"I was severely disappointed by my experience at Five Guys.  With all the hype that this chain has garnered, I found that little of it held up.  As soon as I walked in the door I was overwhelmed by the smell of smoke that the griddle was wafting through the restaurant.  There were plenty of people cooking and preparing the food, yet it all looked chaotic and unorganized.

Just as other people have mentioned, you can choose a whole array of toppings to customize your burger.  That capability is great as long as the cashier rings up your order correctly (which mine was not).  Needless to say I was less than thrilled that I had to battle the smoke so that I could re-explain to the counter staff how my meal was supposed to be prepared.  Along with my burger, I also ordered the regular-sized Cajun fries.  These were definitely fully-seasoned, so if you are averse to spice don't order them.  The regular order of fries turned out to be a modest cup of fries stuffed in a brown bag full of more fries.  It is almost as if Five Guys' strategy is to overwhelm you by their generosity with their fries, so that you forget that their burger is mediocre and their fries are sopping wet with grease.

"This review is for the new children's library on the campus.

The new library is BEAUTIFUL!  I'm hoping that without a lot of kid traffic it may be a sanctuary for teachers who want to be able to find the books they need to bring to their classrooms and share with their students.  They don't have as large of a selection as Burton Barr, but they do have some titles you can't find at the other branches.  The shelves are well stocked but not so tightly packed that browsing becomes a chore.  It's peaceful (like a library should be), but it could use some more seating. 

I have to be honest that I find the coolest part of this library to be the tiny cafe at the back - they serve Starbucks coffee and tasty pastries at very decent prices.  

Books, coffee, and sweets plus silence and organization...... It's like heaven!

"When I think Royal Palms, I think romantic getaway. A quaint yet exquisite resort, the Royal Palms was built in 1929 to emulate a colonial Spanish retreat.

"DO NOT GO HERE.  One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.  The setup is a little like ""Pei Wei"" where they take your order, give you a number, and bring the food to your table.  Placed our order, and had to stalk other tables and hover over people eating trying to wait to get a table.  Waited a long time, all the while others who ordered after us found seats and got their food before us. Servers kept bringing my food to me since it was ready, but I still didn't have a table, so they kept saying they would ""put it under the heat lamp"" for me.  Finally eventually found a table, and then kept waiting and waiting for our food, which the manager claimed ""he had them remake"" since it was getting cold.

"Joined @SMUNCHPhoenix at @GalloBlanco.

For my first breakfast at Gallo, I ordered Chilaquiles Verde, and my girlfriend had the Chorizo and Eggs.

We were both very happy with our choices!

The chilaquiles was delicious, with the crispy corn tortillas providing a nice contrast.

The chorizo and eggs were definitely in line with what I consider to be authentic.

I am definitely a fan of Gallo, and will return as often as time and money allow.",join smunchphoenix galloblanco first breakfast gallo order chilaquil verd girlfriend chorizo egg happi choic chilaquil delici crispi corn tortilla provid nice contrast chorizo egg definit line consid authent definit fan gallo return often money allow,0

"I have owned a Kindle for several years now. I have had the 2nd generation Kindle and I have had the Kindle Keyboard. When my mom expressed interest in getting a Kindle I decided to give her my Kindle Keyboard because she doesnt have Wifi in her house and my older Kindle Keyboard had 3G, which is what she needed. And I decided to buy the Basic Kindle for myself because (1) I didnt want to wait for the Paperwhite to come out and (2) I just needed Wifi and (3)and most importantly I JUST WANT TO READ A BOOK, not listen to text-to-speach, or go shopping on Amazon, or listen to music, etc. All I want to do is read a book...thats it! This Kindle is perfect for that. Its smaller and lighter, the pages turn faster than the Keyboard version, it basically has everything I need to download a book and read a book with a much better price than the Paperwhite or Keyboard. Yes, you have to navigate through the keyboard on this kindle with a 5-way controller, but I rarely use the keyboard anyway. To download a book, I just search and buy books on my computer and send them to my Kindle...which is much quicker no matter what version of Kindle you have. So if you dont need, want, or use all the extras then I would definitely recommend the Basic Kindle for 69 with special offers, because who really pays attention to the screen savers anyway.",own kindl sever year nd gener kindl kindl keyboard mom express interest get kindl decid give kindl keyboard doesnt wifi hous older kindl keyboard g need decid buy basic kindl didnt want wait paperwhit come need wifi importantli want book listen text speach go shop listen music etc want book that kindl perfect smaller lighter page turn faster keyboard version basic everyth need download book book much better price paperwhit keyboard ye navig keyboard kindl way control rare keyboard anyway download book search buy book comput send kindl much quicker matter version kindl dont need want extra would definit recommend basic kindl special offer realli pay attent screen saver anyway,0
"i moved to the tempe area about 2 weeks ago from socal, the mecca for asian restaurants.  since moving out here, my only taste for asian food has been panda express.  well, i was craving teriyaki last night but had no idea where to go so i did a search here.  tokyo house got a bunch of great reviews and everyone mentioned a cool old man behind the counter so i just had to check this place out.

as soon as i walked in the door, i was greeted by the old man...from across the joint, behind the counter, mind you.  he was SUPER nice and SUPER funny!  

checked out the menu and the selection was a bit overwhelming!  they have every teriyaki dish available, and bunch of fried rice and noodle choices, and for those that like rabbit food, vegetable dishes.  i was a bit surprised though to not see gyoza or pot stickers on the menu...was bummed out about that.

i had a hard time deciding what to get but remembered Sarah W.'s review of the house chicken, so i went with that.  i went with a large order and let me tell you; if you're hungry, you definitely will be stuffed after a large order.  the dish was very tasty and delicious and was definitely overflowing with mushroom.  i love mushroom!  the house chicken is supposed to be spicy and although it had a little kick, it wasn't the ""spicy"" i was used to from asian joints in socal.  i wish it had a bit more rice, though.  either way, the dish was great!  i would definitely order it again!

"I have to admit I was a bit hesitate about staying here after reading some of the previous reviews.  We stayed in the 9000 section of the hotel which is behind the convention center part.  I'd recommend this if you want something quiet where you won't get noise from the front parking area or pools.  Yes, I said pools...a great thing for those of us who only wanted to relax and get some sun.
Every staff member that we encountered walking the property was friendly and always acknowledged us.  
We had a two queen room and the room itself was very large and I liked that every room has either a patio or balcony.  Our view happened to be of the basketball and tennis court but it was nice to be able to go outside and sit on the patio in the morning to have coffee and relax.  I assume that we had a room that had already been renovated since the bedding looked new...and the bed was SO comfortable!  
The breakfast buffet is good and it's nice that you can order eggs anyway you like them as part of that.  Other than that we mostly just had drinks while laying by the pool.  

The only negative thing that comes to mind is the fact that the toilets are VERY loud when flushed.  I have no idea if it was the rooms next to us or above us but every time someone flushed a toilet in the middle of the night I woke up....I am a light sleeper but still, if there are more renovations to be done I hope this is something they can address.

"Bring an extra sleeve of balls when you play here for all the water hazards! 

I showed up today (Sunday) and was a little thrown off by all the people at the bag drop wearing football jerseys. Especially when the people wearing jerseys were the ones grabbing my clubs and putting them in a cart. Thought I was at Buffalo Wild Wings! 

I thought this was a very nice course but the reason it didn't get 5 stars was because it just didn't have that top notch feel that other Troon managed properties have. The greens were very inconsistent; some really fast, some really slow, and some were bumpy. The grass on gold was extremely long and it was very easy to lose your ball in the rough because the grass was so deep. Blue was cut much better but I had a couple complaints with holes 7 and 9. If you're playing the blue course in the late afternoon, you might as well close your eyes while teeing off at 7 and 9 because the architect made the course so you look directly into the sun. 

I sneaked on today for $44 bucks and was very satisfied with what I got for the price. If I didn't live 15 miles away, and could always get on for $40 I'd probably golf here a lot more. If the green fees are above $50, I just couldn't justify it with all the other nice options around the valley. 

On a final note, I was EXTREMELY impressed by the staff and how friendly they were. I was not only asked how my round of golf went, I was also told how glad they were that I came out, and finally that they really hope to see me again.

"I'm a little shocked how high this place is rated, to be honest.  I'm not disappointed easily, but I've given this place three chances to impress and they've consistently disappointed.   I live nearby and was very excited for a new, trendy place to eat & drink. The first time we went there, we sat at the ""outside"" bar. The male bartender was not personable at all-he was actually quite rude. When I politely asked him if he knew the price of a liquor off the top of his head (and not to worry about it if he didn't, I was just curious), he snottily replied with, ""well, there's not a button for it so I don't know."" He then rolled his eyes and walked away. I was astounded at how rude he was but shrugged it off. I actually felt bad because I thought somehow I offended or embarrassed him because he didn't know the price of this particular liquor, so I apologized to him, and he proceeded to made another smart comment about how he charged me the well price but that the next time I come in it might be much higher, again being very snotty and rude. My boyfriend was actually pretty upset at the way he spoke to me but chose to let it go because we just aren't the type if people to be confrontational or to complain.  After our meal and about an hour before close, he told us he was leaving and that another girl would be taking care of us. When she showed up all she did was clean the bar in preparation to close (even though that wasn't for another hour) and didn't even introduce herself or say hello. I waited for her to notice that my boyfriend's Blue Moon was empty but she was too busy cleaning so I asked her myself. She asked me what beer he was drinking, I told her, then watched her pour the wrong beer and give it to me as if I wouldn't notice. (Not all alcohol is available at that side of the bar. For instance Blue Moon and the liquor I was drinking are stored at the main bar, another point of annoyance for the original, rude male bartender. But how is that my fault? I didn't know that.  And clearly this girl didn't feel like going to the other bar to pour the correct beer for my boyfriend, even though she specifically asked me which beer he was drinking and then lazily poured whatever wheat beer they had in tap at the bar we were sitting at.) That was the ""straw that broke the camel's back"" for me. We paid out and went to Darcy McGees (in the same shopping center) where the staff are always pleasant and helpful.

We have since given the Lion two more tries but been severely disappointed with the service. The food is excellent- but just cannot make up for the terrible service. The second time we tried this place we sat at the main bar (as to not inconvenience the bartender at the outside bar), and all of the bartenders were too busy talking amongst themselves to notice that both of us were empty on drinks and hungry with no menus offered to us.

Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.

The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.

A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich.",okay found new favorit home offic offic agenc yet coffe shop tend get work done last week check echo coffe client meet realli like today return spent hour work echo coffe wi fi nice break usual home offic starbuck walk echo coffe instantli tell differ type coffe experi environ relax music blast custom scream great big couch back cours atmospher great coffe need balanc definit echo coffe realli good love fair price qualiti get fav cappuccino larg chai latt chai latt came big ceram mug know someth special enjoy coffe big mug recycl paper cup surpris first get actual lunch coffe place pleasantli surpris find food also realli good tell fan yet order curri chicken sandwich huge delici finish whole nice bonu plate mango chutney make sure get order lunch echo would love bowl bread flavor good need find get want home huge chai tea curri chicken sandwich,0

"We were gifted a Groupon for Fuego and had the pleasure of dining there on Friday night. We did not have a reservation, which would have helped us sit outside, but we were seated inside right away. The host was very pleasant and welcoming. 

Much has already been praised about this little gem, and I agree with all of the accolades regarding the atmosphere, the service, the food...it was all wonderful. 

We had the Fuego salad, which was huge and lovely (although I would have liked some diced onions on it; maybe I'll ask next time), the tortilla soup (husband raved about this), the Pulled Pork with cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes and maple-glazed carrots, and the panko-breaded chicken breast with creamed jalapeno corn and maple-glazed carrots. 

In all it was delectable. The entrees were succulent and nicely plated. I particularly loved the creamed corn, which was perfectly spicy and helped clear by sinuses (I succumbed to a bad cold the next day, so maybe I need some more!).

The only thing I would not order again is the carrots. I didn't feel these added anything to our dinners. The maple taste was pretty subtle, to the point of being nonexistent. Also, I think that if you're going to put yourself out there as an upscale restaurant, go the extra mile and use real carrots instead of the bagged ""baby carrots"" that you can find so readily on cafeteria lines. It will look better. 

Our waiter forgot to charge us for the soup. I pointed this out, and he comped us anyway. I will definitely continue to patronize an establishment that empowers its staff to make decisions like that without worrying that they're going to get a dock in pay.

"Let me first explain that we came to the place on a bad night...  Apparently, one of their regulars LITERALLY drank herself to death - spent a week in the hospital before whe finally died.  Instead of a funeral, her husband and family set up a memorial at her favorite bar...  The place was filled with long hugs and sobbing... all while the gal's husband was hammered and wobbled leaning on the end of the bar.  Sad, sad, sad, sad...... on SO many levels.........

That said, we just tried to stay away from it all... and our server (Bobbi - hope I spelled it right) was really great in keeping happy, warm, and chatty.

Ignoring the other patrons that night, then, this place is definitely a great little legit Irish pub (apparently the oldest in the Valley for you history nerds)!

Firstly, they have all sorts of Irish food items (cottage pie, corned beef and cabbage, bangers and mash, beef stew, seafood, and they even have a boxty).  We tried a couple different things that were all tasty!

Next, almost all of their beer taps are dedicates to Irish or UK beers (Guinness, Smithwick's, Harp, Kilkenny, Magner's, Newcastle, etc...)... and they know how to pour a stout!

They didn't have live music that night (apparently, they normally have live Irish bands 6 nights a week)... but they played a great array of REAL Irish music the whole time!

I read a couple reviews that claimed it's not an authentic Irish pub...... but I'm guessing these folks haven't spent a whole lot of time in Ireland?  Understand that ANY bar, in America, has to have cheeseburgers and chicken fingers - because you're not IN Ireland...  That said...... if a bar plays Irish music... has 7 of 10 taps dedicated to Irish and UK beers (with the other 3 Irish or UK STYLE like Killians, Kiltlifter, and Sam Adams)... has all SORTS of Irish food on the menu... real Irish signage (not shamrocks)... proper stout pours in two-parts... plays Irish sports on TV... supports the local Irish clubs..... what makes it NOT a legit Irish Pub?

Now, that could be useful information, but the manner in which she told my wife was defiant rather than helpful.

"I can't believe I haven't yelped about the place yet. Several months (maybe over a year?) ago my husband read a newspaper article about the Clover coffee maker and the one place in town that had managed to procure one. I was skeptical (as is my nature). It can't be that much better right? You're just saying it's amazing because you want to talk about the new hot coffee shop you discovered, right? Well, maybe. But I love this place. And I don't think it has a whole lot to do with the Clover. They roast their own beans and they roast them way differently than that other ginormous coffee chain - all a light or medium roast. Never bitter, never oily, never yucky. The coffee they make there is, obviously, the best. But I send my husband in every week now to buy a pound of beans so that I can approximate the same coffee at home. Add an edgy (though sometimes intimidating) seating area, great local art (which we bought off the wall), and smiley service...I'm sold.

"I liked them a lot until I had to call them to get the discount fare for the toddler but since I was booking our tickets together (because a two year old legally can't fly alone so I HAD to) on the phone, I wasn't getting the lower internet rate.  That's extortion!  I'd much rather do the entire thing on the internet.  Then he tells me that the child's fare goes off of the regular rate which is only one dollar less than the internet rate.  What the hell?  Why would I ever want to sit on hold for 25 minutes to book a flight to get this crap?  Then they tried to get me to pay $15 more for the next class up (I know, upper class on Southwest - strange).  I asked what I got:  1.25 times the miles (yeah, you heard right 25% more - that's going to get me far), first boarding and a free drink.  I clarified that with a child I get to board first anyway (they confirmed this).  Then I asked how much a drink costs.  $5.  So essentially they are asking me to pay $15 instead of $5 for a drink I may or may not want (then again, I'm traveling with a child so who am I kidding, I'm going to need a drink).  And to top it all off, they tell me we can't do on-line check in because Beckham doesn't have a picture ID.  I tell them but he does have a picture ID.  He has a passport, in fact he has two.  The Southwest person tells me no one has two passports so I tell him that no, it's true.  The toddler and I both have two as we have dual citizenship.  (Not that we would need them to fly to California so the whole conversation is entirely pointless now.)  The Southwest man being the all-knowing scholar he is tells me that's impossible and illegal.

"This is a great family resort if you need a villa with a kitchen, washer/dryer and space. We have stayed at Marriott Vacation Clubs all over the U.S. and we really love it here. It's not too big but is in a perfect location for us. You can use the pool at the JW Marriott across the way, but my kids loved the pool here and it's easier to use. The pool was heated to a perfect temperature!  Across the way is the Desert Ridge Marketplace with an Albertson's, 24 hour CVS, Einstein bagels, many other fun restaurants, AMC movies, big box shopping like Marshall's, Ross, etc. It's very convenient for shopping and dining as well as getting to the 101 highway for all of the fun places to go nearby. 

I also found a great nail place across from Desert Ridge called ""All About Nails"". Very nice and very clean - plus reasonably priced.

I am skeptical as to how well the condiment bar looks in good light, which may explain the choice of lighting. Still, grinning and bearing it, I load up my veggie burger with appropriate toppings and, usually with fried zucchini in hand make my way to one of the very uncomfortable seats.

Every time I go to the Chuck Box I feel as if there is going to be something wrong with the food, and this something is being concealed from me by the lack of lighting. Yet, each time I go I have a delicious veggie burger or grilled chicken sandwich. My friends have also enjoyed ""real"" burgers there as well.

"I am just providing a review for the Mother and Infant Care Department only, since my wife has just had our second baby delivered here.

We really enjoy our stay at this hospital. The facility is very clean and nice. Room are good size with shower box inside bathroom, so you can take shower during your stay and care for the mom. During the stay, Mom and the caregiver are entitle to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner for free. All you have to do is call and place your orders. The foods are quite quality and the portions are decent. I am really impressed with this.

The nurses are all knowledgeable, caring, and nice. They are always there when you call them and need them. Since this is our second child, it works out perfectly that the nurses only come by when we call them or when they do their routine checks. So, the rest of the time you are left alone to rest. The hospital where my first child was born was different. They let lots of interns and students come to our rooms all the times for training, so we were constantly bothered. 

However in my opinion, if it is your first child, you may find that having people around all the time could help you not to worry too much (since we all know nothing when the first child come).

The reason I didn't give this hospital 5 star is just because our discharge was taking so long. We thought we would be out by 11 AM, but we didn't get out until 3 PM... They said that because it was on Sunday.  I think it make sense.

"Move over Jacques Torres! Angela has come to town and just might be the next big thing for Phoenix (and the confectionary world!) 

I happened to find this place just on a whim....I was reminiscing the other day about all the wonderful chocolatiers in other big cities, and it occured to me 'maybe there is a chocolatier in Phoenix?'  Sure enough, there is!! (thanks yelp!) and she's GOOD!!!! 

Angela is as sweet as her candy is! She explained how she just started this business in October of last year; she is a self-taught, talented and creative, as authentic as it gets, chocolatier! She uses all organic ingredients, including fair-trade organic chocolate. You will find many whimsical truffle flavor creations like Raspberry Rose, Mudslide, Strawberry Balsamic, Lavender Lemonade, Madras Curry, Avacado Wasabi, Maple-Smoked Bacon (yeah, I KNOW!)....and like a million more! AND the best news of all, is that she says she has perfected a dairy-free recipe for truffles...I. CAN'T. WAIT! I hope I'm the first to order that batch!! Besides beautiful, flavorful truffles, she makes her own marshmallows (in various amazing flavors as well) Chocolate Bark (which is always dairy-free) and even different hot chocolate mixes. 

The most amazing thing of all is....now, get ready for this....all of this magic comes right out of her home kitchen!! THAT means, everything is made with *love* :)  So, if you happen to yelp this, like I did, the map will actually take you to her business, which is located in her house, in a neighborhood (a little confusing at first....) but it IS LEGIT! She said normally it's by appointment only (I was not) but she gladly had me in and I got to see some of her gastronomic creations anyways (yay!) However, she says that she normally sells her stuff at the South Scottsdale Farmers Market (Wednesdays) and the Tempe Farmers Market (on Warner and McClintock on Saturdays) In fact, if you go to her website, you can customize a box of chocolates and pick it up at the farmers market of your choice... (can't wait to do this!!)

"I recently visited Olive and Ivy for business last week, and after 3 visits, I am convinced that Fox Restaurants has some of the best establishments in the valley.  Olive and Ivy is the Fox Restaurant of choice for consistently good food, great drinks, and most of all, outstanding service.  I spend a lot of time in various restaurants across the valley and am always amazed at how bad service can be at some of the more popular valley restaurants.  Not Olive and Ivy.  From the first phone call for reservations, to the greeting upon walking in the door to the smiles and warm reception you receive from every server you cross, this restaurant knows how to make you feel special.

Many of the reviews here will focus on the food and I could spend hours talking about my experiences but I will sum it up in a couple of my favorites. 

I hate dates and prunes, but the bacon wrapped dates are crazy good!
The shrimp and risotto main course is one of the best dishes I have tasted since arriving in Phoenix 3 years ago.  And hands down, their short rib entree is best in the valley.

The only catch is the cost.  Olive and Ivy is not cheap and definitely not for brothers looking to execute the cheap date.  With wine, apps, and main course, you will easy break the century mark, and if you are really being generous, $200 is obtainable.

"There are few things I cannot stand more than eating out for pizza-by-the-slice. Those are: slices so big they contain an entire days worth of calories and charging additional for traditional toppings. 

While I understand the appeal of this centralized pizza joint -- a slice is 1/4 the pizza itself. The crust is a couple inches high and the pizza itself is barely 1/4 inch. I had cheese and while cheese pizza isn't remarkable as is, the slice I had here was considerably unimpressive.

We paid $9.31 for 2 slices and a 20 oz beverage. 

What also put me off to this place was the cold staff and multiple things did not seem to be working right while there -- including their ice machine and their sound system (cut on and off). I was also not impressed how, never truly hearing of Sal's before, the employee made it seem like a chain of few. Go to their website and you will realize otherwise. This location is franchised.

"Owned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos (an Ohio native, fyi) and considered by many to be the best patisserie/bakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempe's plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced; not only does Essence not look like a college haunt, neither do its prices or products - a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my server's accurate assessment that everything was really good.

Now bearing in mind that the original impetus to visit Tempe on this particular morning was to visit Caffe Boa and that Essence was more of 'pre-meal' activity what follows may seem slightly gluttonous, but to be fair once I took my first bite of Theodosopoulos's École Lenôtre trained almond croissant I knew I was in good hands and everything else just sort of followed.  Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall, Essence's $3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of ""big things in small packages,"" and particularly in its still-warm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best I've had stateside.

Moving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essence's ""Signature"" French Toast, a $7.25 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel.  Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be - the exterior crisp and the interior custard-while the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread.

At this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items I'd bought 'for later,' my next two tastes were a pair of $2.95 macarons that, much like the croissant, rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation.  Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palm-sized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue - the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell.

If there were any 'misstep' on the morning, it *might* have been the ""Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding,"" though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the French/English take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style, a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries.  Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me, but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious.

Moving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation, the ""French Napoleon"" gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper Mille-Feuille but also because so many pre-made versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the past...thankfully this was not the case at Essence.  Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess (see ""Mille Feuille New York"") intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux, a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icon's version was I'd be hard pressed to say Essence's was any less impressive.

"Old Town Tortilla Factory does a fantastic job with Mexican/New Mexican cuisine.  The chicken pinwheels that were supposedly featured on the Food Network or something are phenomenal.  There's a good variety of entrees featuring different types of seafood and meat, and plenty of southwest flavors.  The margaritas, served with a little shaker of extra, are excellent too.  My mom actually drank a whole one, which, maybe you don't know my mom, but, trust me, is saying something.  The ambiance out on the patio (when it's not too hot outside) is quite comfortable and cozy, with the fountain and the strings of lights.  Also, they have homemade flavored tortillas, with different flavors featured daily, but sometimes the waitstaff doesn't seem overly eager to give them out.  Had to deduct one star for service.  Other than that, I highly recommend this place.",old town tortilla factori fantast job mexican new mexican cuisin chicken pinwheel supposedli featur food network someth phenomen good varieti entre featur differ type seafood meat plenti southwest flavor margarita serv littl shaker extra excel mom actual drank whole mayb know mom trust say someth ambianc patio hot outsid quit comfort cozi fountain string light also homemad flavor tortilla differ flavor featur daili sometim waitstaff seem overli eager give deduct star servic highli recommend place,0

"Over the last 3 years we've lived in the area, this place has changed 4 times.  First Uncle Bear's, then Tio Oso's, then Thirsty Cactus (or Thirsty Cantina, whatever, it sucked), and now it's TC's Pub & Grub.  The menu is typical bar food, including burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings as well as some taco and quesadilla selections (which I always appreciate a good quesadilla so I will have to try it next time). 

The restaurant section (which was always dead before) has now been opened up and TVs added so the whole place is more of a bar feel (thumbs up).  The place was packed for Thursday night football (Cardinal's game!), but still got a good table close to a TV.  

Server (who admitted multiple times he was brand new) was very friendly but had to keep asking other servers for clarification on menu, etc.  Still, nice enough and very attentive.

We ordered wings (""medium"" but they were spicy!) and their ""ugly"" crust pizza with mushrooms and olives.  The wings, very good, I would get them again.  Pizza, I wouldn't order it again if someone paid me.  The ""ugly"" crust basically is a thick hand tossed crust - too much crust (and half of it was burned) and very skimpy on the toppings.  It was pretty horrible honestly.  The actual toppings (although sparse) were very tasty... good cheese and fresh mushrooms and olives, so I would order pizza here again IF they have a thinner crust option.  Otherwise, if you are coming here to carb load and really need your bread fix, by all means, order the pizza.  I personally prefer a thinner NY style crust.

All in all I would come here again based on the good wings and service, and I'm looking forward to trying their other menu options.

"This place is the perfect example of a tourist trap.  Nice location not far of the main drag of Old Scottsdale, beautiful building and layout.  The margaritas are good, but probably $2-$3 more expensive than they ought to be for every one of the many styles.  I thought paying $5 for chips and salsa was a rip-off, but then when the chips tasted stale, I was even less happy.  C'mon, if you have tortilla and factory in your name, you ought to have fresh chips.  I thought the tortillas themselves were okay, not great, but okay.  The carne fuego, or whatever I had the waitress recommended, was not good.  Small chunks of fire roasted steak completely ruined by a gloppy sweet/hot sauce. The veggies that went with it were just okay and the sweet potato-stuffed chile was weird.  It could've been great, but it was nowhere near good.

"When we first moved to Ocotillo the first thing we did was peruse yelp for the best local eateries. Mikado was one of the first things to splash onto our radar and we had to check it out. Luckily for us Mikado is literally a 2 minute drive from our house. :)

The restaurant is low-key and I like how the lighting is a little dimmer than usual to create a more mellow ambience. The servers are all very attentive and kind which makes the eating experience so much more enjoyable. 

So anyway, on to the sushi! I adore sushi rolls with some kind of crunch in them which is why I love anything tempura. The Big Shrimp Tempura Roll is my favorite and it could stand alone as a meal because it's so ginormous. They stuff 3 large tempura shrimp in there with avocado and cucumber then drizzle it with eel sauce. LOVE! And while I'm on the subject, Mikado has mastered the art of frying up a perfect tempura. Their tempura shrimp is super crispy, isn't greasy and always fresh out of the fryer. The Crunch Roll is superb, the salad dressing is addictive and the chicken noodle udon soup is delicious. Their prices are great and you still get so much food. How can you go wrong? If you're within a 20 mile radius of Mikado you need to stop by.

Also, I can't say this enough: Please support your local businesses!

"Please give this place a try when you're making your next stop at Pita Jungle. This restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked. We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed. Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice. The interior and atmosphere are great. Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar.

An Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. That's the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking.

For our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. I've never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly.

For an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.

For dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best we've had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.

So in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is.

"When I was growing up we called this the canal. In other parts of town it is still called the canal. In some places people actually fish from it. I think they die right after they eat their catch, which is why you don't see them very often. Over the years you periodically hear about dead bodies being found in the canal as well.  Google it.

What is so annoying about this is that Scottsdale, is trying to make it seem like this isn't the same heinous canal that's always been there. When I heard about the development around the Scottsdale Waterfront, I couldn't figure out what they were talking about. What water? Then I started cracking up when I found out it was the canal.

"It's just a terrific steakhouse.  One of the most upscale, all around dining experiences in Phoenix. 

It's expensive.  Very expensive.  But probably worth it.  Figure $150-200 for a couple.

I had the double filet medallion with blue cheese melted and a wine demiglaze.  Absolutely outstanding, amazingly tasty meats.  Equal or better than Morton's or Ruth's Chris or Capitol Grill (that's on the menu for tomorrow night).  Smashed potatoes were very good but nothing to write home about.  Veggies were pretty good.

Started with the ceasar salary, with a big pile of anchovies.  Perhaps the best Caesar I've ever had.

Desert was the mouse cake.  Good, but not to die for.

Their happy hour is also an excellent value.  Come before six and drinks are half off, and they serve little mini steak sandwhiches, which are very good.

Hint:  If you have kids, go to happy hour and have a drink or two.  Cocktails are in the $7 range happy hour price.  Cucumber cooler was quite nice for a cocktail.  Let the kids eat the sandwiches, and then head to the dining room for a couple of filets.  The kids are pretty full, you are nicely primed for a great steak, and the complete lack of a kids menu doesn't matter.  

Honestly, otherwise, there really aren't any good kids options.  I know, it's not a great place for kids, even well behaved, but sometimes you want to celebrate a special occasion with family.  

It would be nice if they offered a mini-filet for 12 and under for like $15, or a burger and fries for $10 for the kids.  Just a thought.

Anyway, great experience, great food.

"After shopping all over town and visiting every single shop in the phx area I stumbled into this little gem.   Store was clean and only stocked with desirable items and lacked the items that just arent used by the majority, but I am sure could be ordered if needed.    This planning I found easy to make my purchases in a quicker manner since I dont always have the time to sort through typical store junk, there just isnt any here! Only quality sought after items.  Management is second to none and the business is family owned and operated.   When you walk in your greeted and after a few visits by name even.  This is a huge plus and isnt found anywhere else in town that I have seen.   There is a prefered customer program and most livestock is local grown and special items are taken in a wish list and you can get called once available.    After my month long search for the perfect store to set up my custom order that could also fulfill my stocking needs I couldnt get my order in fast enough for a complete custom setup installed and delivered.   Pricing was fantastic and cheaper than anywhere in town and the ability to come in anytime and get advice no matter what the need is makes this shop feel like home when you walk in.

It is large enough to accommodate a lot of dogs and people (which there are at peak times), has lots of grass, 2 doggy water fountains so they don't have to drink out of community bowls, trees around the perimeter and a ramada with tables/benches, and other benches located around the perimeter. It is open early in the morning and late at night (there are lights on until 10 PM). There are also city supplied poop bags in dispensers which are usually stocked (although occasionally not, so bringing a bag doesn't hurt).   The people are pretty friendly and the poop  situation (people that don't clean it up) isn't that bad in comparison with many other parks, especially Cosmo and Chaparral. There is only one large section (no small or inactive section), but it seems to work out OK as the dogs aren't overly rowdy or aggressive in general. I've never seen a real fight. There is a sort of walking path around the entire perimeter and many do walk it for exercise.  Overall, a well above average place to take your dog.  

LOCATION:  It's a little hard to find.  Take Kyrene to Carver (halfway between Warner and Elliot).  West on Carver about 2 blocks on the left.  There are other routes, but this is the easiest, unless you're coming from  west of the park.

Only a Mexican food snob would undrmine such a great Traditional restaurant (and believe me we have plenty of those here in Arizona). This is old school Mexican food folks and it's about as good as it gets. The atmosphere is classic and I personally enjoyed it but it is not upscale  but then again Mexican food normally isn't. It's simple and that's what Arriba's is. If Arriba's were located in any Eastern state it would easily be the best in the entire state.

"Was in town for a business meeting and tried to catch a movie with a friend. First impression of the place was that it needed a total make over.  I mean TOTAL MAKEOVER. Walked up to buy my ticket, and the lady was a total jerk! She had no idea when the movie times were, and she clearly thought we were stupid. She messed up our change, and didn't believe us when we told her. When we walked in they ripped the tickets out of our hands.  When it came time to order our food, the butter on the popcorn tasted like cough syrup. The theater was extremely dirty, and kids were screaming throughout the movie.  After the movie I politely told the manager about our horrible experience.  He was not understanding at all and even threatened to kick us out. I was appaled by this whole endeavor and that is why I am writing this review.

"Yes..this is my 6th Kindle Fire HD 7 and I am sharing my story so you are not discouraged! My previous Kindle Fire performed well and I decided to upgrade to the newer model with 16GB. My 2nd Kindle Fire arrived as a Christmas gift and the first week I used it, the unit crashed. Ouch! My previous generation-now referred to as Old Faithful -never failed me. I followed the onscreen instructions for Kindle2 and rebooted my device. After using my device for about 30 minutes, it crashed again and the on-screen instructions said to reboot the reset the entire device. I reset the device and lost all my settings, then again after using the device it crashed. I was not a happy customer so I called Kindle Support.If you are not bored yet...keep reading....Kindle support told me NOT to reset the device, because this erases the memory on their support side and they are unable to resolve the issue from their end if I reset the device. They advised me to call them when this happens. After a conversation about my new device not working, they agreed to send me another Kindle.Kindle 3, 4 and 5 all arrived...and I returned all of them when I discovered they were refurbished units. Since my device was brand new and I had only used it one week, I expected a brand new device as a replacement. On Kindle 6 I ended up placing a new order (rather than an exchange order) and then returned the refurbished units they continued to send me. Problem resolved.It gets worse...Kindle 6 crashed too!

.....I REALLY wanted this to be good.

But honestly, you end up with something that's more like ""flame broiled"" than the earthy wood-fired imagery you pick up from their corporately consistent signage, menu, and decor.

That being said, it's a cool concept, and great crust- but the signature pizzas like the ""Greek"" end up feeling themed ,and lacking of soul and an intuitive fussing-over that they need to really be crack good.

The salad's, while seemingly possessing all the right stuff- are the same. Too salty/ too soggy, and somehow too rich.
The gelato tastes like it must come from a squeeze tube.

"Boyfriend and I went to try Lobby's after seeing the phenomenal reviews.  He got the famous Italian beef sandwich hot with cheese and I got the little veggie sandwich and an order of the chili cheese fries. He got his in a combo that came with a side of fries and a drink. The owner was there and took our order and he was suuuuuuuper nice.  He was really excited for new people to try his food.  

We went and grabbed a table and just as we sat down, a rush of people came in.  There must be a lot of regulars because he was greeting some by name. There must be something to this food for that many loyal customers. 

Not too long after we got our drinks, the food was ready. I decided to immediately dive into the chili cheese fries. The cheese was like the melty nacho kind (not spicy though) and the chili was actually kind of sweet. I wasn't the biggest fan of the chili. My boyfriend did like it and he doesn't usually like chili. I'd probably just get cheese or plain fries next time.  The little veggie sandwich was so tasty! It was lettuce, tomato and pickles (I didn't want onions) with their house sauce on a sesame seed bun.  I'd love to try a burger next time.

The boyfriend did like his sandwich except he didn't know it was going to be ""dipped"".  He doesn't like his sandwiches dipped, so if he were to get that again, he would request it dry.  The sandwich was hearty (I added a pic) and very filling. He kept stealing my chili cheese fries so I take it he liked those too. 

It was really bright and clean in there and the owner and the guy making the food were really cool.  I'd definitely come back. We both want to try the burgers next time.

"I bought these for a couple of reasons.First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people.

Whole Foods Market.
Ladies, you're young and vibrant...today. 
But as the years drag on, you notice changes. Subtle changes, such as:

*crow's feet
*saddlebags
*sagging butt and or tits, 
*and orange skin from all the tanning products, your complexion now resembling that Louie V handbag you've been toting your Shitzadoodle around in.

You've got a choice to make.

Spend all your money now on organic, free range shit, this in an effort to remain healthy looking, or, shop for a lot of the same stuff at Costco, where you can load up, get twice your money's worth, and have a shitload of cardboard boxes you won't have a clue what to do with. 

But the real bonus will be how in only a few short years, you'll have saved enough money for a good plastic surgeon, which you're going to need anyway if you have any plans to remain living in Scottsdale for any length of time.

My opinion?
I highly recommend the latter and here's why.

Scottsdale has a serious shortage of fish-lipped women with feline looking facial features, who routinely wear yoga pants telegraphing their hiked-up thongs. 
Poor thong....how sad that your fate...to be cast to a fifty-something, saggy-butt host.
Ladies, is that what you want?
To idly standby, watching, as the ranks of this bass-cat looking oddity dwindle in population?
I didn't think so.

The choice is yours.
Beautiful and broke from shopping at Whole Foods today.
Or, aging not so gracefully with the help of medical science, an overzealous plastic surgeon, and Victoria's Secret, which I assure you with one of her thongs in yoga pants will be anything but. 
A lot of good all that free range organic crap did. 

If you do come here, try the hot deli, where you can get every kind of ethnic food, save for Ethiopian. It helps after a late night at work, on your way home, when you don't feel like eating fast food. They also have a taco and pizza bar, fresh bakery, and a smoked meats section where you can get some of the worst barbecue and smoked meats I've ever tasted. 
The only thing I'll recommend in this place other than the hot deli, is the chocolate and coffee bar, which seems to have a ton of delights that are supposedly good for you.

"Perfect patio for a Saturday!

This place walks a fine line between being too snooty and being just plain awesome.  I've had a couple of experiences here, and overall the food is really tasty.  I'm a fan of the gnocchi, even though it's a little different than traditional gnocchi.
The location is great, as long as there isn't a douche bag convention going on, and as long as the bartenders and servers keep their positive attitudes, I think this place will be around for a while.

"There's different kinds of Mexican places around.  

Type A:  Pseudo-Mexican fast food (Taco Bell, El Pollo Loco, Del Taco, etc.)

Type B: REAL Mexican fast food (whateveri-berto's, Baja Fresh, Rubio's etc.)

Type C: Various traditional taquerias (Los Favoritos, Rivas' Mexican Food, etc.)

Type D: ""Mexican Denny's"" or chain-type sit down Mexican Restaurants--traditional-style or not (Chevy's, El Torito, Macayo's, etc.) 

Type E: REAL formal or semi-formal Mexican restaurants (I don't know any in the Valley yet, but in the Bay Area there is the now closed La Michoacana in San Mateo, CA, etc.)

Valle Luna is a Type D, and a pretty good one as well.  Delicious traditional-style Mexican food.  The interior looks like what you usually see in a Chevy's or Macayo's.  It's visually pleasing, and service is friendly and helpful.  They have all the beers, margaritas, and tequila that you usually find at places like this (you know what I mean).  It's the kind of Mexican place you take someone for their birthday--exactly.

Do you check in to places on Yelp using your iPhone?   Come to Valle Luna!  Show them the check-in on your phone and you get $5 off of a meal costing $20 or more.  Perfect for lunch with your co-worker.

"I originally came here because I heard they have a gluten free menu--i expected one or two pizzas, probably cheese and one other choice. But they have a FULL menu of pizzas, salads, and appetizers that are gluten free. and they are DELICIOUS! 

Pizza was my absolute favorite food in my past, gluten-filled life. Anything from Slices to Pizzaria Bianco. I have tried gluten free pizzas almost everywhere you can find them, and they are always too dry, too thin, too soggy, or completely different flavor than what pizza crust should taste like.

 Picazzo's gluten free pizza is delicious, the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture, not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be. the flavor is true to pizza crust! my friends even like it so much they will split a gluten free pizza with me instead of ordering 'regular' crust.

There is also a range of appetizers that are delicious, caprese salad with gluten free bread and the spinach dip are my faves. 

The employees are all very nice and aware of gluten intolerance--they check with you before they bring you additional food items or before putting GF and non-GF foods together in your to go box.

"If I could give zero stars, I would.  I have never spent more time looking for a bar than I have looking for this. And not like a cool underground dance club in L.A.  When we finally found this sh*thole sandwiched between two vacant businesses, it was barely visible.  The sign for it looked like it was written with a sharpie on a piece of cardboard and someone duct tapped a flashlight to it.  Before we even entered the bar, as my friend and I were walking up two redneck bikers whispered, ""Fags"" as we walked by them.  I don't think these were the kind of guys you argued with so I let it go.  When we entered the bar I noticed several ""No firearms"" signs plastered on the walls.  I'm assuming they've had a problem with this before.  Remember that scene in the Blues Brothers where they go to the country bar and get the look of death from the patrons?  That's how I felt.  The decor of this bar was interesting.  It looked as if they got the tables and chairs from an old 70s Vegas casino.  The place is about the size of a small apartment's living room so getting a seat is pretty much impossible.  We went to the bar to do some karaoke, but apparently they also sell crappy jewelry for some reason?  Weird.  I've also never heard so much cussing from karaoke singers.  One of the drunken hicks actually got into a shouting match with one of the morbidly obese toothless tattooed bicker chicks where they argued who was the bitch and who was the pussy.

"Seriously?! With grocery stores like Fresh & Easy, Trader Joe's, and even Safeway around here, I wouldn't go to Whole Foods regularly, for ANYTHING, unless I was a bajillionaire. 1. It's wayyyy overpriced. I'm not sure if there's a Central Market around here as haven't seen one yet, but even that is better than this in terms of price! 

We got a few items here, specialty items in bulk foods, for example. The wine and beer bar is cool, but unlike the Whole Foods in Austin, Tx, which was the epitome of awesome, (2) one can't walk around with beverage in hand here. Too bad the rules are so stringent about that, because if I were shopping with a glass of wine, maybe I wouldn't notice the horrendous prices quite so much.

My 3rd complaint is that when we ordered coffees from the coffee stand there, my mocha and my boyfriend's latte tasted like motor oil, after taking forever to be made, and the girl saw me swipe my card but THEN told me she ""didn't have a register person"" and I wasn't able to cancel the transaction....so then we had to go back through the main grocery line again. Grrr.  I left unsatisfied, uncaffeinated, and feeling like I had just wasted ten bucks on coffee that we ended up pouring out. 

They get one star for having a wine/beer bar at all, but then I have to take that star away because the bar tender said they sold the most beer and wine of any Whole Foods in existence (I call bs - the one in Austin is twelve times busier and people can shop with their beverage of choice, and they have a bunch of restaurants there too so it's truly an experience - it dazzles). This leaves one star for the supply of bulk and specialty items they carry. We went to Trader Joe's after, got twice as much stuff, and spent half as much money.

There were a few great locally owned pizza joints where I used to live in Tempe.  Tessio's and Boulders On Broadway stand out, but ya know what?

"Another wonderful little counter joint.  It's extremely basic, no frills, and cheap.  The baklava isn't fabulous, but everything else is worthy of a special trip.  Once again, the chicken shawarma draws me in, though I'll occasionally force myself into breaking out of that far too predictable mold (for falafel since I truly am stuck in a rut).  The hummus is great.  As mentioned, the salads mainly consist of iceburg lettuce, but they are not stingy with the feta and the dressing is amazing.

There is night, semi-scrubby outdoor seating and the drinks are bottled or canned.  Last year I went with a group of friends for Valentine's Day and there was a musician who was slightly too loud for the environment.  When something special is going on, the owner comes around and checks with the patrons to verify quality and whether or not the activity is enjoyable.

"This place is the least douche-filled club of the douche tour in downtown Scottsdale. It is a huge club and in some ways it's like an anchor store in a mall - like Dillards or JC Penny. You can get a little bit of everything you want in one place... It's got its share of plastics and douchebags, but also has a number of college kids venturing away from Tempe to go dancing. 

The place itself is kinda cool with various rooms of different themes and a good sized dance floor. The VIP area upstairs is pretty neat if you can swing the fee. They have the requisite go-go dancers with giant boots on some nights and they often feature good local dj talent.

I haven't had to wait in line to go here in years because I'm always invited to go - I reckon if I had to wait in line, I'd just not go. Don't buy a girl a drink - apparently, this place attracts some pretty (when it's dark) homeless alcoholics. These girls need jobs (and not boob jobs - that's already been covered). 

Myst is large enought that you can go here and manage to find a good time... drinks are a bit pricey, but that's par for the course in the area. It's a one-stop-shop for all your drinking and dancing and scamming needs. You're also very close to a slew of other smaller clubs of the same sort if Myst isn't happening.

One of the best parts is that it's across the way from a pizza by the slice place that stays open after hours just to feed the drunk idiots so they can ""sober up"" for the drive home. Sometimes I go here around 2am sober just to people watch... on any given night, you're likely to see either a fight break out, some drunk chick puke on her hair, or someone crying over something stupid. You also get to see everyone in the harsh fluorescent lights not looking their best - the shine and polish is gone from their outfit and the product in their hair has quit on them and the girls' makeup has given up long ago - plus, they are too drunk to suck in that gut or push out that chest. It's very amusing.

"My sister was leaving back to Texas and I decided to find a BBQ place that may have a similar taste and feel. I found this place through a Mesa newspaper ad.

Anywho, as we pulled in I was like I hope this place is good. We parked in the back and walked along the side where you can order your food to go. As we waited we decided to head inside and as we walked through the dining area to the line, I was already eyeballing other peoples plates. I could see the ribs and at that point I couldn't decided on a plate, but went ahead with the plate that had everything.

I ordered Ribs, Pork, and chicken and as I was ordering I seen some sausage come out of their bbq oven. So I didn't even hesitate because every since I've moved here from Texas, I have yet to find a place to have the yummy peppery tasting sausage we have back home. I asked for a piece of it for tasting and was granted a taste. Needless, to say I ordered a quarter lb with everything else I ordered.

The chicken was without a doubt great smoked bbq chicken I have always wanted. Great flavor with not an overbearing smoke flavor. Also the ribs were tender and packed with flavor and smoke taste. The smoked pork was smoke tasty but a little on the sweeter side, but that was nothing the Habenero BBQ couldn't accommodate. Which is offered on the side.

"Alice Cooperstown is owned by rocker Alice Cooper and is a pretty unique sports bar in downtown Phoenix. Cooperstown was also featured on Man vs. Food.

The most unique item and the biggest draw on the menu is the ""Big Unit"" hot dog. This is by far the biggest hot dog that I've ever seen and the reason that I went to Cooperstown.

The Big Unit is a 1 pound, 22 inch long Vienna hot dog, on a baguette roll. You can choose any combination of 9 toppings for the Unit. 

I went with cheese sauce, jalapenos, bacon, and tomato. The dog had a good taste to it and the bread was fresh. I loved the cheese sauce and bacon, but would probably go without the jalapenos next time. Surprisingly I was able to finish the entire dog, but had to really force the last four or five bites down. I've never felt fuller in my life.

I ordered the two fish combo, and my reaction was...what the..?..are they serious? 

1.) The ""chips"" suuuuck. No salt, overcooked and stiff. I couldn't even eat them. 
2) The two squares of fish I got were alright, but I may as well have gone to Safeway and bought a box of Gorton's fish sticks.

"The boyfriend and I like to do little staycations every now and then so when we saw a deal advertised for the Camelback Inn we jumped on it. We stayed two nights in just a regular room, I guess. They had several different kinds of suites (even rooms with a private pool!) but our room was a standard room with a nice patio facing Camelback Mountain. The room was spacious and clean, the bed was comfy and the patio was the perfect place to enjoy breakfast.

Camelback Inn was much bigger than I expected. Lots and lots of buildings spread out over the property. It's not the easiest place to find your way around but at least it's pretty to look at while you get lost. At the back of the property is a little ghost town set up. It looks like they do corporate events - cowboy cookouts - but nothing was going on while we were there. But we had fun wandering around the ""town"" and taking goofy pictures of each other.

Even though it was December it was warm enough to hang out by the pool. The pool is heated so that helped and there are two hot tubs as well for really chilly days. They have an abundance of lounge chairs and even offer float rafts and fun noodles for the pool. There were kids splashing around but the area is big enough you can hide away from the action if you prefer.

We ate at two of the restaurants while we were there - BLT Steak and Rita's Kitchen and both were fantastic.

"I tried Rare Earth for the first time as a solo diner.  Often a good way to get the take on a new restaurant.  I sat at the bar which has surprisingly uncomfortable seating.  Really hard seats that cut me in the back of the knees.  The wine selection is nice.  Not big but two or three choices of each variety.
I ordered a glass of wine,  a small House salad and a pizza.  
The server behing the bar was ""professionally friendly""  
Then the wait began.  Fifteen minutes passed and I still had no salad.  I was able to get the servers attention and asked about my salad. She didn't check on the status of the salad but gave the excuse that several people had come in around the same time that I did.
Just about 3 minutes later both my salad and my pizza came out at the same time.  Very disappointing.  I wanted to eat my salad but I didn't want my pizza to go cold.  Note: This is extremely thin pizza...like a cracker crust...so it goes cold very quickly.
The server offered to send the pizza back to keep it hot but since it had fresh tomato on it, I didn't want the pizza to be ruined.
The house salad was fresh, good mushrooms and shaved pecorino cheese.  There were lots of red onions and the dressing, a house vinaigrette was very strong ""and vinegary"". For me the onion and vinegar were just overwhelming and I would not order that particular salad again.
The pizza had a good amount of toppings and held together pretty well, even considering how thin the crust is. 

I would like to try this restaurant again because there were several things on the menu that sounded really good.

"I bought these for a couple of reasons.br /br /First, I wanted an earbud that was NOT designed as noise cancelling. I hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them. Apparently, a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not. They are simple earbuds. I hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don't feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out. These are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable. Maybe I have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears. They don't cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears.br /br /Second, I really like the magnets and tangle free aspects of the headphones. I use headphones while I work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when I am finished with them. The flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really tangle when you put them in a bag or wherever. Awesome design.br /br /Finally, the sound I get out of these seems pretty average. I would compare them to the stock Apple iPhone earbuds or a set of Sony earbuds. Nothing special. They are only 25 and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable. Don't expect them to perform like 100 headphones because they aren't designed to perform like that. They are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people.

"I would've gone 2 stars if I were more forgiving. I could reason that it was the end of the day, that a big crowd of wayward children had just come through, or that a hurricane had blown out the back of the restaurant. But then, I tasted it.

It looks as if Yogurtini is pretty well-loved around these parts, and I'm sorry to report otherwise. It's was like a bomb had gone off. The tables were filthy, the machine handles were all gunked up, there was assorted debris on the floor. The two teenagers working were too busy gossiping about who knows what to do their jobs. When we walked in there were a few customers sampling flavors among the ruins, with no employees in sight. We grabbed some sample cups from the register and dodged napkins and froyo puddles (and other customers) to try some different flavors. The levers are the type that if you pull just a bit too far you make a mess all over your hand, especially when trying to squirt a tiny bit in a sample cup. This mess is then added to the greater mess of everyone else attempting this same operation, and no-one attempting to clean it up.

The stuff was real overpowering, to where instead of tasting like what it was supposed to taste like, it was bordering on medicine or like a bad imitation of what it was supposed to be. Like, cheesecake doesn't taste like that, good cheesecake anyway... And neither does cake batter, or banana. Where did the yogurt part go? And how do you screw up cookies and cream, exactly? The two that were the best (and most edible) were the Irish mint and the red velvet, and that's what we mostly ended up with.

The decor didn't add to our experience. Everything is a mint green, but it doesn't come off as retro or even minty, but more like dated and hospital-like. Some people really like it but I found it unappetizing.

A surly teenager magically appeared as we approached the register, only to disappear again soon after we paid. We sat down at a dirty table and dealt with our choices while the two teens again made an appearance, half-mopping-half-attempting-to-clean while chattering back and forth about their dating woes. We finished our yogurt but both strongly considered abandoning the whole affair.

I had Le.  She was so sweet!  I told her all about my date, too.
She was quick, and made some suggestions about what to get.  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.  I was kinda short on time, so I went with her suggestion of white tips.  Plus, it was about $5 cheaper.

"My husband and I were really, really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti.  We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34,000 miles (and out of warranty) to have the moon roof looked at.  The moon roof wouldn't open or close, but you could hear the motor working.

After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered, due to the fact that it's a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.  We were flat out denied.  Twice.  

We were dreading the big repair, and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big, fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.  Seriously?!?!  Just over $100 later we were on our way!

"In a sentence: Culinary Dropout is a foodie mecca with its plush and lux furnishings, amazing location in the heart of Scottsdale but away from the duche-ery of Old Town, on point entrees that range from classic to what I call contemporary chef-y food, and its trendy lil touches like dishtowels for nanpkins and placemat menus. 

After a short afternoon of shopping, I and the other Musketeers ventured into CD in search of yummy goodness... we weren't disappointed. We scarfed down the Pretzel and cheese fondue. Sorry, I can't remember the exact cheese used, but it tasted like cheez whiz without the nasty chemical aftertaste.

The fries were good, I'm sure they are awesome with the steak. Musketeer #2 had the truffle egg scramble. She said that it was good... not bad... but not terrific. We love the truffle, and this did deliver however... it just missed something... je ne sai quai... just something. I stole a bite and concurred... the low point in a overall great meal. 

and me, Miss Musketeer #3 had the coq a vin... a MUST! If that or braised short ribs are on the menu... they MUST be ordered! That's the rule my friends. My braised chicken was good, kind of on the sweet side, but over all very good, although the chicken did have an odd texture, it seemed to me that it could have used a few more hours in the oven. I think this is a dish best served before closing when all the flavors had their chance to really marry. We arrived at the top of dinner service and so the chicken was done... but barely.

Musketeer #2 and I both NEEDED bread and butter, our cooler-than-thou waiter was happy to oblige, even though it took a VERY long time t find him to ask for it in the first place. We capped off the meal with their ""famous"" Monkey Bread, it was definatly worth going bananas over! Warm, gooey, delicious and crazy sweet with its pull-apart goodness it didn't need the ice cream it was served with, but we certainly weren't about to send it back! The three of us died over that one! 

To my yelpers I say: if you have the cash to spend (three of us cost a lil over a hundred clams), a few hours spend on dinner (we were there a while) and a NEED to reach foodie nirvana in order to keep from jumping off a cliff into the chain resturant valley... then this is the spot for you!

Food was good! We enjoyed: the bread, sweet and sour cabbage soup, caesar salad, baby back ribs, salmon, mashed potatoes, and creme brulee. The chopped liver at the beginning of the meal was also a nice bonus!

Only cons would be that the french fries were mundane. Also, we were a little confused about what was a part of the meal (sides, soups, etc), what was an upcharge, what we couldn't add, etc. It wasn't outlined on the menu, and our server had to explain a couple of times.

"My significant other had a $25 off coupon from Restaurant.com LOL. That could sum up the whole trip. I haven't been to many restaurants that participate with restaurant.com that are decent at all. I mean, I wasn't expecting much coming into this place, I shouldn't have expected anything here.

I was in the mood for some red meat, and sushi places do actually have decent dishes like teriyaki chicken and stuff like that sometimes. So, I didn't mind checking this place out since I do like a little bit of sushi on the side. The boolgogee, plain, simply plain. There was a salad with the boolgogee, but it too was plain. There wasn't nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of $8, because the salad and rice probably didn't cost more than $0.50 to make.

Oh, the sushi? All of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy. By spicy, I mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming. I tried a few bites of the 3-4 different rolls we got. After I tried each roll I thought that I liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite. We paid $18 for the food even after the coupon, and I honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper, higher quality sushi at Teharu.

This place is a rip-off for sushi in my opinion. Its not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag.

"Just went to this theater last night, and it was great!  Started with friendly staff...every one of them! (not common these days)  Went to get a popcorn, and the nice girl suggested....""why don't you press your button at your seat and someone will come serve you!  Take advantage of the service!""  We went to our seat and after we pressed the service button, someone came within a few minutes.  There was a full menu at our fingertips...including alcohol and specialty coffees.  Our seats were comfortable, leather (or pleather), roomy, we could stretch out our legs without touching the chairs in front of us, we had 3 cup holders between the both of us, and the seats leaned back.  Not a bad seat in the theater...we got to pick our seats BEFORE we went into the movie on a touch screen computer/pad.  

I'm really impressed with the prices, too, because for just $2 more than a regular, cramped, loud, teenager-infested movie theater, we felt like we were getting First Class treatment, all night!  The snack, food and drink prices are typical for a movie theater; but not more than it would be elsewhere.  Pretzel was about $4.50 and Hummus was about $6.50 for example.  

I'm sad to read Ruth Ann's review because it sounds like an isolated incident, and it also sounds like they did a lot to take care of the issues she had...an experience can't be absolutely perfect.  In my case, there was a little bit of stickiness near my cup holder, but that's not something that will bring my experience down an entire star or 3!

"As a bluetooth speaker, the Tap rocks! The sound quality is excellent, plenty loud when needed, and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming. I bought this one instead of the Echo because it is portable, and I can lug it from room to room. The charging stand is very convenient, and the Tap stays there most of the time. Having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me, but is something to consider. (If you want hands free use, you may want the big brother Echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). The feel of the Tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. The fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. I am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. I found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! I mostly just use it for playing music and asking Alexa silly questions for fun! I occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. Who knows what the future holds,when I have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? I understand that Amazon plans to add more Alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the Tap would eliminate all remotes, which I already have too many of. I think it is a really fun, cool item, and I am glad I got it! It is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! I could get used to this! I have the Alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. The Tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through Wi Fi, no phone needed. However, the Alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the Tap. The Tap can read Audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well!

They told me they make it in varying degrees of spiciness for the ASU crowd. While I disagree with diluting the authenticity of the traditional preparation, I get it - they have a business to run. What I really don't like is how they do it. They make a mild green curry...er, no, green sauce. Then, upon ordering, they add a certain amount of red chili flakes depending on how spicy you want it. This is not only upsetting philosophically, but chili flakes need time to cook in a curry - you don't just drop in, stir and serve.

"I stayed at the Firesky Resort before taking my MCAT and have mixed feelings about my stay. Now granted, I had extremely high anxiety at the time so perhaps I didn't get to see the full glory of this place, but in my opinion it is somewhat overrated. For the price I paid, I expected more. 

The resort layout is more like a fantastically designed apartment complex. In fact, I am pretty sure that it was an apartment complex prior to being a resort. With that said, however, the lobby and grounds are absolutely phenomenal. They are stylish, comfortable, and luxurious without being ostentatious. 

My room was a little bit less impressive though. It had most of the amenities that I expected, but nothing extra. The artwork wasn't overly impressive and the linens were just average. Also, the TV was small. It certainly wasn't nearly as glorious as the common areas of the resort.

The deck/balcony area was very nice though and I was able to study in the fresh air without any distractions.

If you are wanting to stay at a reasonably nice hotel that is close to everything, the Firesky fits the bill. However, don't expect to be wowed by your room. It is an average room.

This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?

So I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert. 

Over all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities.

"I had a lot of fun playing this course today with my 12-year old son (who hits in the low 100s.)  We also played this course back in November when we were here in town and had an equally enjoyable time.

The course is in great shape and we were able to finish our round in around 4-5  hours.  The staff here are very friendly and accommodating and the beverage cart came by around 5 times during our round.  The price they gave us (as return out-of-towners) for a Sunday morning tee-time was incredible - 2 adults at $89 each + $40 rental + FREE junior fees + $15 junior rental.  Other similar quality local courses wanted to charge full fees for juniors for the same tee time, so I really appreciated the gesture. If they keep this policy in tact, this will be my regular course when my son and I come back in town.

As for the course, the early holes are typical resort style holes followed by 5 or so residential public course-style holes. The beauty of this course is the back-9 desert-style holes that wrap around into the south mountain before returning back into the resort with the final par-3 that provides a breath taking semi-panoramic view of the valley from downtown Phoenix to the Superstition Mountains.  I found the back-9 to be short, but very technical, constantly testing my course management abilities - i.e, thought I could hit onto the green (from the whites) on every par-4, but came up short every time.

From what I saw, they had a full bar. Beer selection was good, nothing on tap though which makes me a sad panda. I had to order the thai tea which was very good and tried the thai coffee, also good.
Avocoda curry was amazing! Though when I got the bill I was sad to see that it cost $18... I understand that when they say it's the special, it means that they don't serve it on their everyday menu.

"Cave Creek is a well-manicured muni, featuring a straight-forward layout, nice practice area and large putting green.  There are some elevation changes and some bunkering that add some challenge, but overall it's a pretty easy course.

Some of the better holes are #5, a dogleg right with no room to drive it left (slopes into a hazard), and large green with some tricky pin positions if the flag is in the back.  #8 is a long par four with a narrow driving area and a challenging approach featuring a narrow chute to the green that will most likely need to be hit with a mid-to-long iron (#1 handicap).  #11 is a par 5 that forces you consider fairway metal off the tee, as a driver hit over 260 yds and to the right could likely find a water hazard, and anything left is completely dead.  My personal favorite hole is #18, a short four par with a carry over a ravine from the tee to an uphill, dogleg left fairway with a slope on the left side and a reachable fairway bunker.  

Most of the greens here are fairly large, so lag putting will come into play.  There aren't any tricks here - it can suit fairway-green style and the bomb-and-gouge crowd.  The driving range desperately needs new balls, but the course is a solid three stars.",cave creek well manicur muni featur straight forward layout nice practic area larg put green elev chang bunker add challeng overal pretti easi cours better hole dogleg right room drive left slope hazard larg green tricki pin posit flag back long par four narrow drive area challeng approach featur narrow chute green like need hit mid long iron handicap par forc consid fairway metal tee driver hit yd right could like find water hazard anyth left complet dead person favorit hole short four par carri ravin tee uphil dogleg left fairway slope left side reachabl fairway bunker green fairli larg lag put come play trick suit fairway green style bomb goug crowd drive rang desper need new ball cours solid three star,0

The cheddar cheese in my burrito was moldy. And no, I'm sure it wasn't blue cheese. It was even obvious visually. After pointing the cheese out to the manager, she brushed it off as ""the bag was just opened, it's not possible"" even after showing the obvious mold. People around me started looking uncomfortable.

One Love Boutique Spa consists of the waiting room/reception area and the services room.  Its small, cozy but super cute and inviting. I love the way it's decorated which is what drew me to buy a Groupon for a signature facial after looking at the website. The decor is white, clean, girly and classic.

I was disappointed at first when my initial appointment was cancelled two hours before I was scheduled due to Amanda coming down with something that was contagious, I guess I was thankful too.

When I came in for my facial I explained that I was one of the appointments that was rescheduled due to her illness and she upgraded me to the anti aging facial for free!  She also includes eyebrow waxing with every facial which is awesome! The facial was AMAZING and Amanda is very knowledgeable about what she is doing and the products she is using. 

Before my facial started I had asked her to mess up my hair as little as possible since I was going somewhere right after, she kindly obliged  and when I left my hair looked exactly how it looked when I came in.

By far, this is the LARGEST club I've been in! But my list of places to visit is still very long, so there may be bigger. I liked it here, the girls and managers, and this is important to me, were chill and nice. Some variation in looks for the girls but not much, but then again, maybe there is more to select from at night. I'm a day club visitor, because I hate to pay cover and other unnecessary costs.

And it doesn't end there, there was a more private but large room toward the back with another stage and tall pole. There's an upstairs to this place too!

You know for that kind of one-on-one that no ones all up in your business about kind of room, just you and the dancer...Then there is the balcony that wraps around the upper floor, plenty of seating, with DJ in the center, spinning whatever the ladies on stage ask for (this is rare, some DJ's will tell you to take a flying leap if you demand a song, so I've been told...).

And if that wasn't bad enough:  I went with a group of friends and we all ate at the buffet.  Now, in all honesty, some of the food there was pretty good:  the shrimp, the prime rib beef, the stuffed cheese lasagna, etc.
Some was pretty bad like the ceviche  and the desserts--OMG--how bad they are.  
My cheesecake was, obviously, a day or two old and had that refrigerator slightly hard crusting over it--plus, ever so slight smell from the fridge.
Not yummy.  The pies were alot of filling and few pieces of fruit.  Just cheap desserts, so stick with the meat and fish.

And guess what?  The $4 comp money never showed up on the card.
If this Casino thinks I would actually spend money to sit in their stinking cigarette smoke loaded casino, they have another think coming.  Hell no!
I also had a ticket to see their Showstoppers ""show"" which, if it sucked as much as their slots and crappy old desserts, I figured it wasn't worth it.

"The burgers here are pretty average.  Thin, flat, kind-of greasy patties with lettuce and tomato.  But what sets this place apart is their other offerings.  My husband got the tri-tip steak sandwich and he said that it was delicious.  The meat was very tender and cooked perfectly.  I loved the fact that they serve sweet potatoes fries.  Those have become very popular lately but this is the only fast food place I know of that has them.    The ones I tried were cooked perfectly and very lightly salted.  The onion rings were also cooked just right with no soggy pieces.  I thought that the batter to onion ratio was slighly scewed toward the former but my hubby thought they were perfect.  Their regular fries are also very good.  I tried the chocolate shake and it was really yummy too.  I think its great that you can get a veggie burger here as well as a tuna steak sandwich.  The extra toppings they offer such as sauteed mushrooms, avacado, and teriyaki and BBQ sauce are all a big plus as well.

The decor is simple since it is a fast food joint.  The booths were big and comfy and the faux leather looked slightly more upscale than you would expect.  We went on opening day so the service was phenominal.  We didn't have to wait long for our order and everything was to our specifications.  Servers came by serveral times to pick up trash and offer to refill our drinks.  The restroom was very small but clean. I try not to eat fast food too often but I will consider coming back next time I am craving a burger.  Or maybe I'll give one of their salads a try.  They earned a repeat visit from me and an extra star since they donated 100% of their opening day profits to Phoenix Children's Hospital.

"I really enjoy this course but I am saving the 5 out of 5s for the Troons, Grayhawks and WeKoPas of the world.  Nonetheless, this is a great, very challenging course and you don't have to drive waaaay up north or east of Scottsdale to get there, which is always a great plus.  I remember Golf Digest did a list of Top 25 College Courses and this didn't make it, which I thought was nuts.  My only complaint is that the course isn't really as luxurious as the peak season rate would indicate.  Also, as the other guys who reviewed this mentioned, there is some fantastic ASU swag available in the shop if you are a fan, they probably have every variety you could ever imagine.

"First I would like to say that I am coming from using Google TV. Fire TV is a great device. The voice search is accurate at picking up what I say. My biggest problem with this device is also with the voice search. Coming from Google TV if you used the search feature if would look for it in more places. Lets say I am searching for the movie Gremlins. On Google TV it would look for it in Netflix, Amazon Instant, instant prime, Google play store, HBO Go, and you get the idea. This device for example will not check Netflix. So I must do a voice search to see if it is on Amazon, if not I must open lets say Netflix and use the up, down, left, right buttons and manually enter the letter to find out if it is on Netflix. That was the big issue for me. A small issue is the amount of apps. No HBO Go, Google play store, and others. I am not blaming amazon for this. It is an open system so HBO and others just need to make the apps for it. This devise is quick, and amazon items start up instantly, but not Netflix.

"I struggled a lot on whether to give this a 3 or a 4. Honestly, I'm not happy with my decision and I'm thinking it may deserve a 3. This place is new to me, but I'm no stranger to ""Mongolian BBQ"" as I've been a long-time fan of YC's. Obviously I'm going to compare the two. 

I liked that they had fresh meat, but it was a little fatty and since they use thicker chunks as opposed to shaved and frozen, it takes longer to cook your food. They seem to stack up orders on the hot disc. It definitely lacks the flair you get when eating at YC's, but the novelty of that wears off after a few times anyway. Plus, I know it's wrong, but I prefer the frozen shaved meats to these chunks. It's just different though - I wouldn't say frozen is better, just that I prefer it. 

I would even go so far as to say I preferred a lot of their fixin's outside of the meat. They had a better selection of spicy powders and sauces than YC's, and this place definitely caters to the spicy food lover more. They also had better vegetables. I should also mention they have a better selection of meats including two types of beef and even shrimp and scallops. Even your choices of noodles and rice was more extensive. Come to think of it, they really beat the shit out of YC's hands down in the available food department.

And taste? Well, it was delicious I must say. Of course, I assembled the dish, so if it wasn't any good I have to accept at least part of the blame if not all. If I had to compare, I'd say YC's is very reliable and good consistantly because I tend to always create roughly the same dish. GG's I could see having a much broader range of flavors and experiences. 

The ambiance was okay for a strip-mall restaurant. It was kinda kitschy, but charming enough and fairly comfy. They had attention to detail. I think YC's (depending on which one you go to) is a ""no frills"" sort of place compared to this. They were piping in some good contemporary alternative music as well... for a minute, I thought someone had lifted my ipod.

Service was attentive, but odd since this is a ""get your own food"" kind of place... They also have menus which is strange considering you basically put your own dish together and since the server explains the process again to you in detail. I felt a bit like a child being explained something so simple and obvious, but my girlfriend had a confused look on her face, so maybe it's a good thing they do that. Regulars probably just get escorted over to the line.

I think my main gripe with it was the tiny bowl they gave me for the fixin's... but then again, you aren't putting noodles or rice in there like you do at YC's - they add that as they cook it for you. So I suppose the portions are comparable. Then there's the price. A little high perhaps - maybe higher than YC's (I know they used to be 5 bucks for a lunch bowl). But you do get a lot for your money if you know how to pack the food in the bowl. 

So I guess I was right to give it a 4 instead of a 3... turns out I really liked it. I think this would be a real treat for someone who hasn't had Mongolian BBQ before.

"After checking into our lovely suite at the Montelucia my hubby said he was in the mood for some chips, guac and a margarita. I think he had mistaken Scottsdale for Mexico and unfortunately the restaurant at The Montelucia (Prado) had none of the above. Instead we enjoyed a glass of wine (Riesling for me), a bowl of gazpacho and shared the snapper ceviche.  Service was a bit on the slow side, but the tasty food made up for it...

We ended up back at Prado the next morning for breakfast- we were quite starving after hiking Camelback (or part of Camelback).  I was a bit disappointed with their breakfast menu. They had very few things to choose from besides the $25 breakfast buffet. I wasn't in a buffet kind of mood, but it didn't seem like we had a choice. However, I seemed to get the most out of my $25 after stuffing my face with an omlette, mini breakfast burrito, fruit, yogurt parfait, etc.  Our waiter did a bit of a disappearing act, but fortunately we didn't need him much for the buffet.

I traveled to Phoenix only a few days away from the LA marathon in March and was determined to start carbo loading early. My first stop was Matt's Big Breakfast, a place I had patroned back in 2010. That time I ordered the item that Guy tried on triple D and it was really good. He ordered the chop and the chick which was a pork chop and two fried eggs. It was delicious, with a great pesto topping, I only wished I could have had more pesto but they may have given it to me if I had asked.

The restaurant is small usually with a 10 minute wait even for one person. I didn't mind and hung out with the locals for a little bit before I was able to sit at the bar. The decor and ambiance is not much different than most other small breakfast spots but it is clean and welcoming. The staff was nice and took my order quickly and it was only a short while before my order of the hog and the chick was in front of me. Placed at my spot of the counter was beautifully cooked think cut peppered bacon, crispy hashbrowns, and two perfectly cooked over medium eggs. Everything on the plate was cooked really well and was a perfect breakfast. The eggs were right under medium which is where I like them and the hashbrowns were crunchy and crispy on the outside while still creamy on the inside. Somewhat like a potato latke, just without all the onion. By far the star on the plate was the think cut bacon. Sometimes when a restaurant says that the bacon is think cut it really isn't and other times it is so thick that it comes out uncooked. Matt's got it just right and peppered right to the edge of too much. Just where I like it. I could have eaten platefuls of this stuff, if only they were in LA at the end of the marathon.

The last thing in my order was the real reason I returned to Matt's. Each breakfast arrives with a side of bread of which you have a few options. Bread aside, the start was the strawberry jam they served on the side. The jam is without a doubt the best thing in the restaurant. It is super sweet with chunks of fruit inside. It has so much flavor in such a simple concoction, I could eat a jar of it. Too bad they only give you about two ounces. I wonder if they bottle and sell it because I would buy.

All in all Matt's Big Breakfast is a really solid breakfast joint in downtown Phoenix. No wonder it always has a wait. The peppered bacon was delicious and the rest of the meal was nothing to scoff at but, in the end, I would come here every time I visit Phoenix just for the strawberry jam. Check out Matt's Big Breakfast the next time you are in town and let me know what you think.

"Man oh Man!   Since leaving New York six and a half years ago I have been in search of good Chinese Food.  I had gotten to the point where I would have even settled for ""decent"".  A work colleague suggested that we dine here on the way to a corporate meeting.  While I realized that he was a native to the Phoenix Metro Area and had probably never even had the real thing, I trusted his palate and restaurant sense.  I was so pleased when we walked in and saw that the diners were predominately Asian.  I knew that  a great  Asian market was next door as well and these things were the first things that signaled to me that I was probably going to get good food.  I was thrilled to see familiar Dim Sum carts rolling through.  We were a party of 7 and shared around.  The food was fantastic!  Dim sum was fresh and succulent.  Our orders from the menu were equally delicious.  The veggies were fresh and brightly colored.  The tastes distinctive and delicious.  The Hot and Sour Soup was perfect filled with all kinds of Chinese mushrooms etc.  I was delighted and reminisced about the many fantastic dinners in Chinatown NY. This food was comparable.  I do not live close by, but I will be a regular there.  Chandler is clear on the other side of the World from me but I figure if Marco Polo could do it, so can I!

"I saw the reviews of this Arribas and thought to myself, ""Are these people talking about the same Arribas I went to last night?"" I went there, and had an awesome time! Service was prompt, and if something was off, our server Jeff (who was amazing) explained why something happened, but didn't blame anyone, and didn't use server jargon. I do understand the jargon, but it was nice for someone to not have to resort to it. 

Warm chips and salsas + warm bean dip came out = awesome and the spicy salsa was calling my name. It burned, but I loved it. I ordered the Rio Grande enchiladas with the carne abodoba, and ordered it extra spicy. (Of course, I would) I was with my girl (and she likes strawberry margaritas) so we split the house margarita for 2, frozen with sugar of course. I'm not a huge margarita person, but it was really good. She ordered the cheese enchiladas. (She takes safe choices when we go eat) -more on the margaritas in a min- 

Food come out and seriously, it was some of the best spanish/mexican I've had in a while. Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food. It was fresh! Which is hard to find these days and I'm pretty sure the people who own Arribas own a hatch chile farm because I rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros. Which is cool. Those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70's. I'm not kidding, when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want. Black, pinto, or the 3rd kind that is a combo of black/pinto with some onion, tomatoes, and of course, what's that? Hatch chiles! I highly recommend them. I liked how Arribas uses the hatch chiles. It sets them apart. It brought the heat!

After dinner, I ordered another margarita...

This time, I asked Jeff of a recommendation. Why do I do this? Because the people that work at any restaurant know the food/drinks there more than you will ever know. 'Nuff said. He brought out some margarita I don't even know the name. It kicked my ass, thank god my girl was driving home, that's all I'm going to say. Thanks!

That's why this place gets 5 stars. It deserves it in my opinion.
I think because this place takes chances with seasoning and overall outlook is why so many people might be unhappy with Arribas or this location in general. I on the other hand PROMOTE this thought process. I don't want food that's bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food. That makes for a BLAND place that's filled with, well, bland people. This place uses heat, salt, pepper, and other spices that I don't know of. What a freaking great idea! Too hot for you? Then don't eat food that is 99% based on heat.

"Since I was in AZ area for the weekend with my gf for pleasure we decided to visit one of my friends in the area. She picked this place and we decided to get seafood instead of steak or a meat house. 

First of all, I'd suggest making reservations otherwise DO NOT COME HERE. We showed up at 7pm but weren't seated until 845. Good thing we ate a really good lunch otherwise I'd be starving and complaining like a baby. At least this gave us time to have a few drinks before dinner in the LARGE outdoor waiting patio area. I think it was so crowded because it was the weekend before Fat Tuesday. This place kinda reminds me of Bubba Gump or something similar. It seems fun and they do have a large bar and waiting area. 

We ordered alligator and frog legs as an appetizer. LOVED IT!!! We wanted the fried alligator and frog legs but the waiter absolutely loved that he worked here and HIGHLY recommended that we order it grilled instead. Since he worked here, we figured why not? I was thinking to myself that the cooks were a bit lazy and maybe they didn't want to prepare it. Lol. To my surprise, it was good as he mentioned. I have had both before but not for a few years so I was pleased. My gf ordered the crab stuffed shrimp which was really good. I ordered a  combination seafood plate which was good but not great. 

There are way too many things to order on the menu. A lot of fried food so if you are trying to watch your diet/weight then don't come here.

"Inside the Clarendon Hotel in central Phoenix, Gallo Blanco has quickly made a hit for themselves with hipsters and urban dwellers alike. They offer a refreshing alternative for hotel restaurants, with lively ambiance and great food and drink.

Gallo Blanco's tacos are surefire hits. They're served individually, and come lined up in an appealing silver taco stand. We've ordered the carne asada and shrimp soft tacos, and, wow, they're really mouthwatering. The shrimp is flame grilled and seared, bringing out a nice full flavor. The guacamole is slightly sweet and chunky, and paired with outstanding tortilla chips, this is a must-order appetizer. Even the sauces (I prefer the red chipotle one) are addictive, either to accompany the supreme tacos, or to be enjoyed alone on chips.

This restaurant is a fine addition to the emerging downtown Phoenix foodie scene, and with prices extremely reasonable, you get a lot. A good sized meal for two (sans drinks) could ring up at $30-35, which is a good value for great food. Try Gallo Blanco, bring friends, and get a bunch of items.

"Was in Phoenix for a softball tournament this past weekend and stayed here cause it was one of the host hotels for the tournament.  

Front desk staff were friendly and fast so check in was a breeze.  The room was great. Had 2 double beds in a separate room and a queen size pull out. Beds were comfortable and linens were above normal hotel quality. Bathroom was big...though it contained the closet which was kinda weird. Towels were over sized and very soft. Small balcony was nice.  Parking was in a structure next to the hotel and we never had a problem. Loved the atrium like interior of the hotel. 

The only cons I can think of were
...the elevators were kinda slow.
...the toilet didn't flush right away and you had to hold the handle down a few seconds.
...and the hash browns at the breakfast buffet were extremely dry hahaha

"I pre-ordered this for my wife mostly to use as a Kindle E-reader as I figured the tablet would be slow and the display would be less than impressive. I was wrong. What a bargain this little beauty is! This model cost 49.00 but it comes with ad's displayed on the lock screen when your tablet is dormant. Once your screen times out, they disappear. You can pay 15.00 up front to get an ad free version so I assumed to unlock the tablet I'd have to spend 15 to 30 seconds looking at an ad for Amazon Prime, or a product from the daily specials section of Amazon.com I abstained from paying for Ad removal and was pleasantly surprised to find that the ads are only on the lock screen and that as soon as I unlock the tablet they disappear immediately.Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5 phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look greatPrice - it's a 50.Read more",pre order wife mostli kindl e reader figur would slow display would less impress wrong bargain littl beauti model cost come ad display lock screen dormant screen time disappear pay front get ad free version assum unlock spend second look ad prime product daili special section com abstain pay ad remov pleasantli surpris find ad lock screen soon unlock disappear immedi pro con thu far pro perfect size ebook web surf allevi strain eye phone displaynic sturdi case give nice heft still weigh lighter tablet marketchild account allow set age restrict access kid make low cost piec tech perfect school kid allow mom dad ration amount lil johnni play clash clan much hit ol visa card batteri life thu far wife hour last night batteri kindl integr goe without say ebook audibl book sync awesom kindl book look greatpric,0

"What an amazing Mini Vacation.  I went in August which was about 105 degrees but it was perfect.  The pool was relaxing, the water felt great and I enjoyed all three nights of my stay.  We decided it was so great we never left the resort.  

The Room was very clean and very comfortable.  

Talavera had the most amazing Fish Entrees, the seabase OMG I can still taste it, the salmon was the best I have ever had, and I dislike salmon completely.  The service through out the restaurant and hotel was amazing.  The special drinks they had were very tasty and made the 105 degrees weather manageable.  

The brunch buffet and breakfast at Crescent Moon is excellent all three days, so fresh, the pomegranate fresh juice was amazing I had three.  The food tasted like the items were freshly picked that morning.  I literally gained 5 ILBs on this trip and it was worth all of it.  

The Lounge had tasty small Tapas which I enjoyed while it drizzled that night, the whole hotel has a great relaxing ambiance.

The nights were amazing to walk around the hotel or sit around the pool with the night lights on and enjoy the peacefulness of the resort.  I believe we saw bats flying around in the middle of the night. which was very cool.  

Worth every penny.  Just watch out for Camera Speed Traps on the way there.

"A friend of a friend was telling us about this place on Sunday morning, and how awesome their pizza is.  It sounded awesome, but he warned us the line is usually an hour and a half long.  Oh well, we went anyway.  Luckily, we were early enough where we didn't have to wait long for a table.  When we were leaving, though, the line was easily an hour long.

We started with the wings, which come in an order of 14 and were delicious.  Five of us were dining there, so we ordered two small pizzas, with each one being a half, so we had a nice variety of pizzas to try from.  We got the BBQ Chicken, the Frisco, Grandma G's, and one more that eludes me now.  All were pretty delicious, and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique pizzas with untraditional toppings (Grandma G's had potato on it).  Our entire bill with a few drinks came to under $80.

Oh, make sure you sit outside... the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each wall and annoy the hell out of our party.

"We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.  Good food, good service, good ambiance.  We came back here for Father's Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!  Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of ""computer malfunction' they claimed, but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering, no food, nothing.  The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that! 

 Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again.",went mother day base posit review pleasant experi good food good servic good ambianc came back father day unpleas experi worst display manag ever encount appar order never put server sort comput malfunct claim wait tabl minut order food noth server obvious recogn mistak kept check us apolog unusu long wait mention restaur half empti wonder offer comp coffe drink infuri part final complain manag could figur ridicul long wait came tabl properli introduc sat point man held comput system told us wait minut realli come tell us long wait rude disrespect tri argu point us clearli show server put order immedi probabl server apolog us umpteen time ridicul display manag manag custom servic year clearli manag mistak never apolog tri rectifi situat come custom fight mode realli cannot rectifi needless say unless restaur start provid better train manag team member hire new manag come back,1

"I finally got the chance to visit Lola on my way home from a poetry reading at the Phoenix Art Museum Last night..(Side note: If you get the chance to see Aaron Johnson read, do so.)

I somehow feel the need to appologize for the lack of stars to all of you who seem to love this place. I would certainly be willing to give it another try but I was not impressed.

First the music is loud, and therefore everyone talking in the place turns up the volume and as my girlfriend and I were seated across from each other at the communal table we could barely reach to share the food let alone hear each other.

Why are the tables so big if the food is so small? Maybe I am a bit of a glutton, but for 8 dollars I essentially ate a mushroom for dinner...Don't get me wrong it was tasty, and I understand Tapas are appetizers, but 8 dollars? I was disapointed. I used to go to Firefly in Vegas and it was cheaper and tastier.

We just wanted to try this place and move on someplace quieter, but I was really looking forward to it...We decided not to have drinks and simply share one thing so we could get to said quieter place before it got too late...I think because we ordered so little, the waitress considered us a waste as far as her tips were concerned and therefore seemed not so friendly...and those little bitty glasses of water they bring...I drank immediately and it was never refilled. 

I was overall not impressed by anything except a patron's sweet ass Salvador Dali Mustache.

"beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you don't drink tea?  really.

The crazy thing is, i'm sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill?

When I mentioned it to the cashier, she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  ""oh, is this your 1st time?  we can remove it from the bill""

I said forget it, keep it.

i usually tip 20-30% but i'll just let them keep their meager 65 per charge.

  yeah, really worth losing a customer for?

my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water.

gone are the $2.15 per item flat rate (can you say bait and switch?)

$2.35 PER so now they're no different from the rest of the dim sum places.

as sneaky as C-FOO trying to strong arm the 15% gratuity (which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers)

so in a down economy, you're supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges?

it's the chinese way i guess

"I read that the guy who owns GoDaddy shot an elephant...at night...using spotlights...I'm thinking his fully tumescent ""manhood"" must be the size and color of a 7 year old raisin...I can't imagine what he thought he was proving by felling one of these magnificent creatures with high powered/laser sighted rifle from 500 yards away, while it stood transfixed by the spotlights glare.

There was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer, when I was a kid back in Oregon...""Asshole"".

He did prove to me that I will need to move any and all business I can away from GoDaddy...""vote with your feet""...but I guess that's another review.

The Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us!

At the very tippy top of the ""near and dear"" list is our lovely daughter, Whitney.

Whit is a Vegan...with a capital ""Vege""...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist.

So she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case!

I am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare rib-eye...I don't think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart!

I checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing!

We ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynami's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich!

Even after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week!

The big question about Green is ""why didn't I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?""

I don't know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye t-shirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again.

I like to ""fit in"".

The menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma's (always a big deal for me) are both exotic and welcoming.

I didn't have to break out the bacon (although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary).

I really could eat this way on a regular basis...it's that good...I probably won't, but it's nice to know I could!

I imagine that Karma will have it's own way of dealing with a self-justifying, trigger happy technotard...for me, the occasional dinner at Green nicely balances the Karmic forces at work in my life...and tastes good, too!",guy own godaddi shot eleph night use spotlight think fulli tumesc manhood must size color year old raisin imagin thought prove fell magnific creatur high power laser sight rifl yard away stood transfix spotlight glare word use poacher hunt deer kid back oregon asshol prove need move busi away godaddi vote feet guess anoth review beauti carin scottsdal busi past week take opportun spend near dear us tippi top near dear list love daughter whitney whit vegan capit vege distraught wanton slaughter african eleph dot bomb misogynist thrill meat lovin daddi go take green dinner experi alien made carin pick pound fulli cook bacon bring dinner purs case vegan born rais cattl ranch love good medium rare rib eye think hurt elsi cow teat twiddl cream coffe chees burger yet eleph deal brought tear daughter eye touch black flinti excus heart check yelp saw vegan friend yelp love place decidedli carnivor yelpi friend also nearli unanim agreement green foodgasm induc order way much food chili fri egg roll green burger secret bbq chicken sandwich harm chicken parm bare room choke coupl tsoynami oatmeal cooki sandwich even stuf whitney took home enough leftov week big question green ever eat live know put hemp cargo short tie dye shirt grow neck beard eat like fit menu fairli extens portion plenti big flavor bright well defin textur aroma alway big deal exot welcom break bacon although taken flask cocktail green donald oh well agav sugar cola delight departur ordinari realli could eat way regular basi good probabl nice know could imagin karma way deal self justifi trigger happi technotard occasion dinner green nice balanc karmic forc work life tast good,0

The menu is ginormous.  I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.

"Over the years, I've tried a variety of cases for the various models of Kindle and Fire tablet that I've purchased from Amazon. While I've found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive, I found myself coming back to Amazon's own product when I purchased one of their new 7 Fire tablets, and I'm pleased with it.This is a very good quality cover, it fits well, and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation. It's made of fabric on the outside, with a microfiber inner lining to protect the screen of the tablet when the cover is closed. It matches the color of the Fire tablet perfectly.My only hesitation in purchasing it was the price - the case all by itself is fully half the price of the Fire tablet! But I suppose that says more about how cheap the tablet is, than how expensive the case is (kind of).Still, I decided to spend the money for this case. The tablet needs the protection and I know from experience that Amazon's cases are durable and will last for a long time (I've used my original Kindle Paperwhite - first generation model - with case since it was first purchased).I'll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet.

I told her that I called just two days earlier and she just stared at me. No attempt at fixing anything, nada. One drunken patron at the bar yelled to open the bar back up, but I was over it.

Just when it looked like the town would outgrow Mesa, the vein faulted, the grade of ore dropped and the town died a slow painful death.

"A small bite goes a long way. I first was introduced to these brownies in '09 when I received a variety box with 12 sprites and a can of cocoa for Christmas. I love the packaging - the deep purple and brown on the box and wrapper. After devouring my first brownie, I was an instant fan. The card in the box said you can freeze the brownies for up to a month but it was gone within the week. The can of cocoa lasted for a good 3 months. I used it for baking - cookies, breads, cakes, etc. 

My faves: Cream Cheese, Espresso Nib, Toffee Crunch, and Caramel. 
The sprites are just the perfect size because it's just enough to get your chocolate fix but not overwhelming. I just throw one in my purse before I leave the house and I can have it with my coffee in the afternoon.

"It takes a lot to impress me.  I hate most everything unless a place is so awesome it blows my friggin' head off.  Sign of the whale accomplished this task.  Allow me to elaborate...

The first time I went here, I received awesome service.  Did not have a bad thing to say about the place.  Was waiting for my party to arrive and sat by myself.  The bartender was awesome, started bullshitting with me and making me feel more than welcome.  The owner is always walking around the place, making sure things are cool with ALL of his customers.  Seriously, all of them.  The guy kind of reminded me of Eugene Levy from the original vacation movie.  I almost expected him to try and sell me a Metallic P.  Anyway, the guy was cool as hell.  Making sure everything was good with our food and drinks.

Now the drinks... Wow.  They don't cheap out on the pour with these bastards, and they are not overpriced for what you get.  I have no complaints about the strength of these things, and that is always my first test if a bar is worth a shit.  if you own a bar and I have talked shit about the strength of your drinks, I invite you to go to sign of the whale.  I practically challenge you, like we should meet at the flag pole after school challenge you.  Let them show you what having a dick is like and how a drink should poured.    I hooked the bartender up on the tip, he deserved it.  I would go as far to say that I would almost take a bullet for that guy.  If I had a vagina, I would probably offer to father his children.  Well, that isn't true.  If I had a vagina, I would spend all day looking at it in the mirrior, but you understand what I am getting at.  You are as sexy as a Ferrari, good sir.

The food...  Damn.  Goddamn.  Who the hell is the cook there, Emeril?Only had appetizers because they were on the cheap but between three of us we had 4 orders of appetizers and left full.  And I am fat.  Not quite Paul Blart Mall cop, but more of a Corey Haim 2007 era. 

Regardless, want a great place without giving you any shit and keeping you drunk for less, hit this place up.  It is like a high priced hooker for half off, you can't go wrong.  The only gripe I have about this place is they seem to be a Green Bay Fudgepackers bar, but I guess no one is perfect!

"If you're in the mood for a foodie adventure, I've got just the thing. A trip to the Caribbean! Head on over to Tempe and enter A Taste of the Caribbean restaurant. The bright yellow and green walls, red floor and outdoor furniture will make you feel like you've arrived. It's kind of scruffy and laid back - this is not the place to come for a quick bite. First of all, you have to make the tough decision about what to order. Oxtails or goat? Jerk chicken, of course, or do you want the milder brown stew chicken? Fish? There's snapper, tilapia, and shrimp. The menu is divided up into Caribbean Favorites, Friday and Saturday Menu, Lunch Specials, Rice Bowl Specials and Plate Specials. If all this has your head spinning, you're not alone. Our server, part of the family who own and run the place, seemed equally confused. But she was charming. Just accept it, and the slow service as part of the experience - don't worry, be happy.

     We ordered oxtails ($11.95) and Eggplant Curry Shrimp ($9.95). The oxtails, in a brown sauce, were fall-off-the-bone tender, fatty, as oxtails are, and totally delicious. The accompanying plantains were caramelized and a little crunchy. Perfection. A huge mound of rice and peas filled the center of the plate - moist and beautifully seasoned. And finally, a side of cabbage. There must have been a little sugar in the cooking pan, because it was sinfully delicious. Served on the side was a basket of roti, a homemade flatbread, similar to a flour tortilla but much softer. It was so hot we burned our fingers trying to pull off a piece. We had finished off the oxtails when the eggplant dish arrived (they were supposed to have come out together - it's a good thing we like to share). Be forewarned, this curry is not for the faint-of-mouth. I wasn't expecting the degree of heat - my nose started running and my eyes watered. But it was pure bliss, with flavor layered on flavor. The shrimp were perfectly cooked, although I wouldn't have minded a few more, and the eggplant was so tender it was almost melting into the gravy. There were also some pieces of potato, which had not been mentioned on the menu, hiding in there. The heap of rice and peas helped mitigate some of the heat. As you might have gathered, between the roti, the plantains, the rice and peas,and the potatoes, this is a carb-lovers paradise.

     Two odd things: a wide variety of Caribbean sodas are sold here, but no ice tea. And the rest rooms are in a different building than the restaurant.

     The only disappointment was dessert. I got a pineapple tart to take home (I couldn't have eaten another carb if my life depended on it). Our server had said it was the best of the two desserts available. Uh-oh. The tart was really bad - a smidgen of decent pineapple filling wedged between layers of leaden dough, tough and greasy.

"I have heard so many good reviews for this place, so who wouldn't try it? I should have taken the hints before I got my meal, that this wasn't a good choice.

Hint 1: Location - It's right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park.

Hint 2: Food test - It was nice that I got to sample the food even if the first sample wasn't up to par, the guy wouldn't leave me alone about sampling.

Hint 3: Decor - I know this should never have anything to do with the food, but it felt like I was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town, wobbly chairs, wobbly table.

I ordered the teriyaki chicken (didn't think it would be bad, I mean who can mess up teriyaki?) With chicken fried rice (once again, how on earth can you mess up fried rice?) 

The chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day. Such a horrible taste. The fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out, kind of had a gross tangy after taste. There also wasn't any spices or egg in the fried rice, just a bunch of green onion,which technically isn't a fried rice. This meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store.

They also give you a snickerdoodle cookie, that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu, until I noticed it wasn't cooked all the way through.

But the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair I found floating in my teriyaki sauce.

2. Super Nachos - I don't understand how you can not finish this one. They give you a ridiculous amount of chips with a mexican buffet on top, but once you get the hot sauce on it, you can't stop.

"From my door, it's a five minute stroll through the greenbelt to Dukes. They have a nice patio. They have enough TVs to show all MLB/NFL/NBA games. They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables. Yet, I've only been to Duke's a few times and I am not going back. This place is just bad.

Mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when they're on ""special.""

The food is pretty bad, even for bar food. And pricey. Sure, the menu is gigantic and I've tried many different items, but I didn't find anything good. Everything seems to be made from ""freezer to fryer"" or packaged products. I'm not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin, previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries. I could go on about salads, sandwiches, and ribs. In the same price range, you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devil's Advocate.

One of the owners was there on a few occasions. I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his. He treats the place like his kingdom. He'll ask patrons ""how is everything?"" and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say. I feel bad for the rest of the service staff; they seem to be above average, but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesn't matter.

"This review is composed as a companion piece to the other positives on this page, so please read those for details I won't repeat.
   I think Jason B.'s comments most accurately mirror my overall feel for this place. And, while I find Nick S.'s opinions undeservedly harsh, they do contain kernels of truth that shouldn't be entirely dismissed either.
   Regarding cleanliness: I contend that Tony's operates on the ""European Standard"". So ,if you've ever been, you know. If your home has anti-bacterial soap pumps at every sink, you carry antiseptic wipes in your purse or on your person at all times, and you fixate on the illusion of a 100% microbe-free world, you may want to ""pass"" on visiting Tony's. I'd assume then, that you would also avoid any contact with street vendors and food stalls in places like Mexico, Madrid, Bangkok, Hong Kong, et al? Yeah, we're all free to set limits on our individual tolerances, but at what cost to the fullest enjoyment of all that our one, single, lifetime has to offer? Scorpions on a stick, anyone? Perhaps a chilled brewski for starters. Do you do calamari, or not?
   If you're of the more adventurous sort, at least poke your nose into Tony's for the cultural experience. I consider this place a bona-fide living history museum, with a least three generations of family in evidence, and at your service. Want the lights on in the grocery? Ask. Have a question about ANYTHING? Ditto.
   Also, take time to see the mementos, memorabilia, kitsch, and exotic products liberally displayed on,behind ,and above the counter and entry. Yeah, there IS dust, but for me that doesn't diminish the faded, festive charm in the least. Nor does it alter the palpable sense of eras past, and present, that this place evokes in me. See the vintage ('50's?) black and white photo of Elvis w/some past friend or relation. Or, more currently, the color shot of, and shout out from, the entire Orangewood Cheer Squad of '09.
   I admit that not everything at Tony's is superfine, or to everyone's particular taste. I don't especially care for the coarse grind of their sausage, for example, but the sliced meats and cheeses are very good, and well priced. I WOULD recommend checking expire dates on groceries, since the turnover on these items is unknown. I've found outdated items at AJ's, Fry's, and  almost everywhere else.  It happens.
   If you're up for a purchase, let you senses (and common sense) be your guide. I ""second"" the votes for the subs, and the standard size, traditional cannoli @$2.15 is a bargain. (compared to $7 at Aiello's restaurant on Central, which I haven't tried.)
   Another bargain here is the bulk olives. While I'm not a big fan of green or kalamata types by themselves, a good tapenade is always welcome. With jumbo plain greens @$3.50lb., and Greeks priced at the upper end of $5.49lb., you can pay $11 and up for the same thing elsewhere. Let the Snoot in you decide.

   To wrap, YOU NEED TO KNOW about their SICILIAN olives.
They're black. They're ripe. They're wrinkled, and dry-cured, and shiny. They're salty,(very) not sour. They're earthy, deeply rich, and complex. They're meaty, satisfying, and delicious. They're addicting. They're sprinkled with fennel seed, red pepper flakes, and (on a good day) bits of fresh garlic. They conjure Mediterranean breezes, raven-haired maidens in aprons, and hillsides with goats. They're seaspray and sunshine; they're sublime. And they're $4.49. Match with a favorite wine, a crusty loaf, a chunk of cheese, and you're home.. Where the heart is... OR, you can eat them like candy. Try at least ONE in your lifetime.
   Sadly, Tony's skips the minced garlic more often than not. If your purchase comes without, I strongly encourage you to add your own at home.

"I see one word come up again and again in the reviews for this place: ""Cute"".

Well, it is cute. The lighting and furniture and concept are happy, kind and appealing in an innocent way. The patio is cute, too.

And it's not Applebee's. Oftentimes I'll be with a group of people trying to decide where to eat and drink. Someone will say ""Applebee's at Central and Camelback"". There will be groans. Then someone will think of Maizie's across the street and the response is ""well, it's not Applebee's"". Then we go there.

"This bar reminds of an old pair of pants. It fits. Not too tight, not perfect. Just kind of fits. There's some holes in the knees, and its a bit faded. It's certainly not perfect.

Mulligans is that bar where you can go and kick it with your friends. You never know what kind of people you are going to run into. Co-workers, drunkards, bottle rats who got kicked out from other places.

The drinks are cheap. The beer selection is so so. The bartenders are pretty nice, but aloof. It's just an average bar though.

"VERY FRIENDLY staff.  In fact, at times they seemed to be just a bit too friendly.  I get that they train their employee's to greet every guest, but everytime you see an employee, or make eye contact, they are either welcomeing you to the place, or asking how everything is going.  It was a bit of an overkill.  And the place is loud. Very Loud.  So loud it is hard to hear your table companions.  And every so often, the music would go up a little louder, and all the employees would stop making sure every single customer felt welcome and aprreciated all the time, and they all did a cute little line dance.Other than that, the place is great.  Nice atmosphere, great peanuts.

The food is reasonably priced and so very tasty.  I am sure they know this, because they are constantly asking how your meal is.  Well, not constantly, but pretty darn close.  I had the T-Bone smothered in Mushrooms, and it was cooked to perfection.  The rice side dish was a little sticky and over-cooked, but other than that, the food was an 9 out of ten.  

After we paid the bill and started to the door, again the service was overwhelming when no less than four seperate employess thanked us for coming and hoped we enjoyed our meal.  The place was packed, but still seemed a little over staffed.  I do like to feel welcome in a resturant, but not every time I turn around.  Still, I think I will be returning for a good, resonably priced meal.",friendli staff fact time seem bit friendli get train employe greet everi guest everytim see employe make eye contact either welcom place ask everyth go bit overkil place loud loud loud hard hear tabl companion everi often music would go littl louder employe would stop make sure everi singl custom felt welcom aprreci cute littl line danc place great nice atmospher great peanut food reason price tasti sure know constantli ask meal well constantli pretti darn close bone smother mushroom cook perfect rice side dish littl sticki cook food ten paid bill start door servic overwhelm less four seper employess thank us come hope enjoy meal place pack still seem littl staf like feel welcom restur everi turn around still think return good reson price meal,0

"I've not stayed at this resort, but have been here twice; once for a wedding and the other for a Lunch & Learn event.  Valet service each time was quick and the guys were professional and pleasant.  The grounds of the resort are kept meticulously clean and there were clear skies and greenery everywhere I looked; so beautiful.

Lunch & Learn (Aug 18th):

The event started a little past noon and ended a little past 3pm.  We reserved for six, but it's based on a first come, first served basis.  Two of us arrived a little after 11:30am and after paying our respective $75 fee, went to find a table that would afford us good views of the chef's station.  Unfortunately the best tables (with direct views of the chef's station) had ""Reserved"" placards on them, so we ended up with one off to the right of the chef's station.  I would recommend arriving early to grab good seats; tables are set for ten.  There are two large TV screens in the room, in case you're not able to see the chef directly.  

Our event was hosted by Chef MacMillan (gave the guests a few good laughs), with featured guest chef Kevin Binkley (owner of Binkley's Restaurant in Cave Creek).  The servers weren't obtrusive and kept our water and wine glasses full.  

We started off with a glass of champagne, which wasn't great, but was appreciated and added to the festive ambiance.  For this event, we were served three courses:  an appetizer (chilled cucumber soup), entrée (two-wash ranch chicken), and dessert (huckleberry semi-fredo).  Each course was paired with a different glass of wine:  John Anthony Sauvignon Blanc (white, appetizer), Andre Brunel Cote du Rhone (red, entrée), and Pietro Rinaldi Moscato d'asti (dessert).  I'm not usually a fan of Sauvignon Blanc (I favor Riesling), but the John Anthony won me over.  

Chef Binkley went over his background and demonstrated the process that goes with making the chilled cucumber soup (which is quite involved).  The soup, albeit a bit salty, was SO good.  Everyone raved about it, and the best part of the dish for me was the charred red onion.  The two-wash ranch chicken entrée was good overall; however, my chicken was a bit dry and tough to cut.  This might be a one-off thing since others at the table said their chicken was moist.  Loved the sweet potato puree and Chantrell mushrooms.  The only real complaint I had was the lack of a demo for the entree and dessert.  With that said, I can understand why the chef needed to be in the kitchen...after all, we needed to eat, right? ;P

Other highlights:
*  Live band entertained with great hits (a bit loud though for lunchtime)
*  Recipes to take home
*  Q & A with the chef (and photo ops)
*  Raffles for a few prizes, which two of my friends won (a gift box of caramel brownies and one-night stay at the Sanctuary with dinner)

Wedding (Friday, March 23rd):

The ceremony was held at 5pm on the grounds near the ballroom.  The weather was a bit warm, but not unbearably so.  The bride and groom were beautiful (so was the service), but it was a bit distracting to see people observing us from the windows of the Jade Bar, which overlooked the grounds where the ceremony was held.

After the ceremony, we took a short hike up the stairs for cocktail hour, held just outside the ballroom.  It was such a beautiful experience to have a glass of wine, nibble on hors d'oeuvres, chat with friends, and watch the sun go down (with the mountains as a backdrop).

The reception was held in the ballroom and was decorated beautifully.  The food was great, the wine and alcohol was flowing, and the live (Latin) band made for a great evening.  My friend used Sanctuary's wedding planner (and caterer) and they did a great job.",stay resort twice wed lunch learn event valet servic quick guy profession pleasant ground resort kept meticul clean clear sky greeneri everywher look beauti lunch learn aug th event start littl past noon end littl past pm reserv six base first come first serv basi two us arriv littl pay respect fee went find tabl would afford us good view chef station unfortun best tabl direct view chef station reserv placard end right chef station would recommend arriv earli grab good seat tabl set ten two larg tv screen room case abl see chef directli event host chef macmillan gave guest good laugh featur guest chef kevin binkley owner binkley restaur cave creek server obtrus kept water wine glass full start glass champagn great appreci ad festiv ambianc event serv three cours appet chill cucumb soup entr e two wash ranch chicken dessert huckleberri semi fredo cours pair differ glass wine john anthoni sauvignon blanc white appet andr brunel cote du rhone red entr e pietro rinaldi moscato asti dessert usual fan sauvignon blanc favor riesl john anthoni chef binkley went background demonstr process goe make chill cucumb soup quit involv soup albeit bit salti good everyon rave best part dish char red onion two wash ranch chicken entr e good overal howev chicken bit dri tough cut might sinc other tabl said chicken moist love sweet potato pure chantrel mushroom real complaint lack demo entre dessert said understand chef need kitchen need eat right p highlight live band entertain great hit bit loud though lunchtim recip take home q chef photo op raffl prize two friend gift box caramel browni night stay sanctuari dinner wed friday march rd ceremoni held pm ground near ballroom weather bit warm unbear bride groom beauti servic bit distract see peopl observ us window jade bar overlook ground ceremoni held ceremoni took short hike stair cocktail hour held outsid ballroom beauti experi glass wine nibbl hor oeuvr chat friend watch sun go mountain backdrop recept held ballroom decor beauti food great wine alcohol flow live latin band made great even friend use sanctuari wed planner cater great job,0
"Mosaic is a gorgeous restaurant in North Scottsdale, near Pinnacle Peak. I imagine that they have magnificent views of the desert and mountains when it's still light out. The dining room is pretty small, so I'd recommend reservations. If you can't get reservations, I'd caution against dining in the lounge. Although they serve the full menu there, the lounge is actually in its own room and usually pretty empty, so it would detract from the whole experience. The service here is pretty close to perfect - these are professionals, the kind of staff that's trained to stop and step aside as you walk past them, even if they're not in your way at all. The gourmet cuisine here is great - not as inventive as Binkley's, but just as well executed. The menu changes often, so I can't really recommend any particular dishes, other than the amazing Thai shrimp and coconut soup, the one dish that's always on the menu. I would not recommend ordering their foie gras, if it's on the menu. It was the only dish that really missed the mark. I've only had foie gras one other time before, at Picasso in Vegas, so I don't have that much of a basis of comparison, but the foie gras at Mosaic was way inferior to Picasso's phenomenal foie gras (my understanding is that the best foie gras should be firm, smooth, a little buttery - there's here was watery and blubbery). However, that was the only ""miss"" of the night, out of our many courses. For a special occasion or a splurge night out, you won't be disappointed by Mosaic's beautiful restaurant and surroundings, excellent staff, and wonderful food.",mosaic gorgeou restaur north scottsdal near pinnacl peak imagin magnific view desert mountain still light dine room pretti small recommend reserv get reserv caution dine loung although serv full menu loung actual room usual pretti empti would detract whole experi servic pretti close perfect profession kind staff train stop step asid walk past even way gourmet cuisin great invent binkley well execut menu chang often realli recommend particular dish amaz thai shrimp coconut soup dish alway menu would recommend order foie gra menu dish realli miss mark foie gra picasso vega much basi comparison foie gra mosaic way inferior picasso phenomen foie gra understand best foie gra firm smooth littl butteri wateri blubberi howev miss night mani cours special occas splurg night disappoint mosaic beauti restaur surround excel staff wonder food,0

When were able to finally get in, we were offered drinks, and ended up getting sweet tea, which I don't care for.  I got the smothered pork chop and two sides, the mac and cheese and the black eyed peas.

The chips and salsa are a great starter. You get three tasty kinds of salsa: brown, red, and pico de gallo. The tortilla chips are fried perfectly. They are extremely light and crispy.

I tried the steak tostadas. The meat had a food flavor and the tortillas were nice and crunchy. The red jalapeño and fresh cilantro on top brought excitement to each bite. 

The dishes are small, but they are are also inexpensive at $6-10 each. Along with the chips and salsa, I got plenty of food, so portion sizes are only an issue for big eaters. It seems like a great place to share several dishes between everyone.

"I ordered this as soon as it was available and it arrived this morning. For background, I also have an Apple TV, which I hate but my kids love. I also have various WDTV models, Which I love. The reason the kids love the Apple TV is that the interface is so slick and quick, which the WDTV certainly lacks in. This Fire TV is even better IMO than the Apple TV and the WDTV doesn't even come close. Unfortunately, the Fire TV misses in a huge way for me by not allowing the play of external content through the USB port from attached storage or memory stick. If it had that capability, and hopefully it will in the future This would be the perfect device. This is why I am still hanging on to my WDTV as my go to player. It will play virtually any file format you throw at it which is a priority to me. I have been reading about the Plex app and that may satisfy my needs as well, but I haven't dug deeper or tested it out. If that is not the case for you, than the Fire TV would be a great option. I am not familiar with Roku, because I could never justify the purchase due to the inability to play content from local storage. Unfortunately I jumped the gun with the Fire TV because I saw that it did have a USB port and made the assumption it would support external content.

"Went to the market for the first time today and I enjoyed myself.  

I loved seeing the herbs and plants I could grow for my own veggies (some of them were ""pre-tortured under the AZ sun""... loved that line) and smelling all the great concoctions that people make.

The creativity... it's awesome.  I love going to those craft fairs and seeing stuff, but I like seeing soaps and art and other various items that people will put together on their own.

It was super nice that they had portable evap coolers blowing down the aisles and lots of shade.  

It was very comfortable, lots of tasters and the music is great.

I told friends that I would be going here today, and they all said, ""Oh I wanna go!! I'm so jealous!!""

Now I see why. :)",went market first today enjoy love see herb plant could grow veggi pre tortur az sun love line smell great concoct peopl make creativ awesom love go craft fair see stuff like see soap art variou peopl put togeth super nice portabl evap cooler blow aisl lot shade comfort lot taster music great told friend would go today said oh wanna go jealou see,0

I'm gonna be real with you. I am not in love with Pizzeria Bianco, and had I actually had to wait in line, this rating would probably be lower. My group was lucky enough to receive the last table without any wait.

Maybe it was the fact that it's hard to impress me with pizza. Maybe it was a fluke that won't happen again. At least that's what everyone keeps telling me. But honestly, I just wasn't that impressed with the $19 pizza I received. Sadly, the leftovers I took home ended up being tossed because I was afraid to try it again.

From San Diego,
1. they made us wait in line for ticketing.
2. Made us go check our bags

3. Bag agent told us the flight has been delayed 35 min and we have to wait in the ""special needs"" line bc we were gonna miss our connection flight. 

4. Booked another flight. Meanwhile got barked at my a brainless, incompetent, mean lady that was a complete b*tch to us.
She told us there was plenty of time for our next flight and that we should patiently stand in line (and miss that flight).

5. Got on the runway. Plane circled around for about an hour. didn't take off.
6. ""mechanical problems"".
7. kept ppl on the plane for another hour.
8. kicked everybody off saying we weren't taking off on this plane.

9. made everybody wait in a long@$$ line that didn't move while we saw a ticketing agent to rebook our flight (while I held up a DELTA SUCKS sign made with pen and crayon on my sketchbook)

10. hours later after not knowing what to do with us, they placed us in a hotel in downtown SD.
11. We were to take an 8 PM flight the next day to LAX and then 2 hr and 45 min layover.
12. 11:45 PM plane from LAX to Tokyo.... scheduled 4 AM landing in the far east, you kidding me? 
13. THEY LOST MY LUGGAGE.

"It's unfair to review this mall on what it was - since it no longer is (and what it is isn't as good as what it was). It's also unfair to review this on what it will be - since it isn't that yet. 

Today, it's a mall I rarely visit. Apart from a few stores I would visit out of convenience or necessity, there's not much to offer compared to what it used to have. The fantastic movie theater, Jutenhoops, Alpine Ski Keller, Bear Cover, and even Ed Debevics are all long gone... oops, there I go bringing up the past. Seriously though, these were painful to lose - one by one.

So today, there's a Linens 'n' Things which is hardly unique, and a Trader Joe's which is nice to have in the area, and also a Sister's Attic and Closet upscale thrift stores which add a bit of much-needed flavor. The Chili's, the Bookstar, and Black Angus are still around. So is the jewelry store that has never really offered a compelling reason to enter. They've wedged an LA Fitness here and they've also added a Blimpie and an Arby's... all very healthy choices. 

Besides all of the generic shops and eateries and standard offerings, there's still a few unique experiences - though nothing like it used to... shit, there I go again. Anyway, so there's a few places that aren't screaming ""standard mall"" such as Pita Grill, a pipe and tobacco shoppe (you have to spell it that way in this case), a place to get eyewear, and some other small and uninteresting businesses. 

In that sense, I suppose this is has become a decent and convenient neighborhood strip mall. This is a shame really since it's lacking most of the key elements that made it really special. It's still a beautiful outdoor mall and the architecture alone makes it a unique alternative to the cookie-cutter malls that strategically litter the landscape of America. 

I'm worried about what they'll do to the architecture when they renovate this place someday, but I think the fact that this mall isn't terribly interesting anymore in general means it won't be so terribly missed when they lose that last remaining bit of ""special.""",unfair review mall sinc longer good also unfair review sinc yet today mall rare visit apart store would visit conveni necess much offer compar use fantast movi theater jutenhoop alpin ski keller bear cover even ed debev long gone oop go bring past serious though pain lose today linen n thing hardli uniqu trader joe nice area also sister attic closet upscal thrift store add bit much need flavor chili bookstar black angu still around jewelri store never realli offer compel reason enter wedg la fit also ad blimpi arbi healthi choic besid gener shop eateri standard offer still uniqu experi though noth like use shit go anyway place scream standard mall pita grill pipe tobacco shopp spell way case place get eyewear small uninterest busi sens suppos becom decent conveni neighborhood strip mall shame realli sinc lack key element made realli special still beauti outdoor mall architectur alon make uniqu altern cooki cutter mall strateg litter landscap america worri architectur renov place someday think fact mall terribl interest anymor gener mean terribl miss lose last remain bit special,1

The seating is not comfy if you like to slouch. If you sit up straight, it's fine. But seriously.... good posture is over rated.

"Bizarre. My family of 5 came here for lunch one day, to see what all the hype is about - and boy did Hana fall FLAT! I personally had no expectations and Hana still missed them. 

Before seating us at a LARGE table (there's maybe 10 tables in this joint), this obviously inexperienced hostess first looked unsure of where she should seat us (the table for 2 or for 4?) She then proceeded to rearrange the table for 4, and moved ALL of the chairs around the table to add 1, instead of just adding it to the empty space on the end of the table.... odd.

And then our waitress.... was really abrupt and ungracious about things. My sister's accompanying salad was half covered in lettuce rust - and when she showed the waitress, all she said was ""so do you want it?"" Uhm, no thank you, I like my food fresh, not rotten, but thanks.

The sushi was pretty much the same thing covered in different sauces. Annnd they were pricey. it was kinda sorta really unbelievably ridiculous. RIDICULOUS, i tell you! Not worth it. No way. I'm quite sure that the ""crab"" was imitation. And the fish wasn't even that fresh. Granted, we're in the middle of a desert, but still. 

The one redeeming quality of this place? The ramen. Although there were about 10 noodles in it, the pork was perfectly cooked. And it would have been nice if the chef had been a little less stingy with the ramen noodles. 

Would I come back? Uhm.... only if I had no choice and was craving ramen. But for sushi?

"Just isn't very good.

I don't understand why people give this place even three stars.  It's rare for me to give a place a low rating, but, My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse.   The food is not even close to any representation of what good Greek food tastes like.

I've been to this place several times over the years.  This location and others.   It used to be just on the lower end of OK...  it's never been as good as you can get from a 'Ma and 'Pa place.  However, we went for lunch the other day and it's just gotten to the point I wouldn't even go back for a quick bite.

We ordered the garlic hummus, and it was overly full of garlic and not home made.  It seemed to be loaded with garlic powder, as opposed to fresh hummus that just had roasted garlic in it.   The olives we ordered were rough at best.  UGH even thinking about them.  Overly seasoned and not very fresh.   The rice was over cooked and was so soft it lacked any sort of texture.

The first rule of good let, alone great food, is FRESH.   This place needs a rescue.

Less critical, but, I think an overall representation of what has happened to the place, the menu's were totally trashed.   As in ratty, tattered, and dirty.  The lamination was coming off them and they were dirty.

Pros: wider assortment of toppings and menu items, including the veggie sandwich (not a soy pattie - just veggies and cheese, if you want; extra menu items like jalapeños and hot sauce, grilled mushrooms, etc.; Cajun styled french fries (their small size is enormous).

Cons:  more expensive than In 'N Out. 

Neutral: Thick burgers are more like your home grilled burgers, all well done and crispy on the edges - not like In ""N Out's thinner patties.

I don't know why people compare the two places since the prices are not similar.  Five Guys is good, but should be compared more to places like Fat Burger, regarding size and price of burger.

"I have been parking here loyally for several years but the last two times have prompted me to look elsewhere. The location is somewhat good but stinks if you get stuck behind the train since it is just south of the train tracks. The shuttle are fairly frequent and prices reasonable. What has really rubbed me the wrong way is the service. Okay, maybe just one particular driver. The second to last time we used this place, it just so happened that the driver that dropped us off at the airport wrote down the wrong place. When we were taken back to the parking lot, the driver kept arguing with me and saying my location was wrong. It was to the point, he was almost ridiculing me in front of the other passengers. When we finally located my car, I showed him the ticket where the location was written. His response was that the original driver was an idiot for writing down the wrong location. No apology to me for his behavior. We used Sky Harbor during Christmas and we got the SAME driver again after being picked up and taken back to the lot. Turns out his behavior was the same and this time I watched it exhibited towards other passengers in addition to myself. My husband thought it might have been his sense of humor but yelling at other drivers in the parking lot is unacceptable. Besides this idiot's behavior, during the holiday, Sky Harbor Parking had cars parked in front and behind vehicles in middle rows. There were three couples who were blocked in when dropped off. I couldn't believe it. Who wants to deal with that when traveling all day? Thankfully, it didn't happen to us, because I would have blown a fuse after dealing with the driver.

Franco was our waiter - and I'm guessing since all the ladies at the table had a crush on him, that he is the waiter Sheila B wrote about in her review too.  Nice eye candy!

I absolutely love the eggplant rollatini and pretty much order it every visit.  We usually start with a Giuseppe's Salad and finish with a dessert to share.  My favorite is the white chocolate tartufa.

Pasquale (pictured above) is the sweetest man and makes the experience extra special every single time.

"What an incredible little hidden gem!  I have lived here for 10 years and been to Richardson's a number of times, but I never even knew that Dick's Hideaway was around the corner hidden away behind those beautiful bougainvillea's.  The dcor was warm and woody with a very nice rustic feel.   This little place has the all the charm of the guys working inside.  As cozy as it was, I immediately felt like I just walked into that place 'where everybody knows your name'.  My friend's and I met for breakfast.  High top wooden rustic table or belly up to the bar?  Very comfortable, either way.  I was expecting the typical two egg breakfast, but to my delightful surprise, they have their own spin on breakfast.  Not sure if any of you had been to Richardson's (same owner AND same owner as Rokerij), but I swear they have the best red sauce on the planet.  I had 2 eggs, over medium, next to some rancho beans topped with a little bit of cheese, and some breakfast potatoes, ALL on top of a fresh flour tortilla.  The best part?  My eggs and beans were topped with their famous red sauce.  OH YEAH.  We were in heaven.  I think we have been there once a week ever since.  Highly recommended!

"Been to the Saigon Kitchen 3 times now.  Once with a friend, another with my teenage daughter and other on a lunch date with my husband.  Will have to say have been absolutely pleased each time.  I ordered the Shaken beef (diced Filet Mignon) each time.  Husband ordered the Chicken Curry (which he liked) and we enjoyed egg rolls.  

The food has been hot, tastes fresh, excellent presentation and absolutely delicious.  Portions, in my opinion, are definitely a good portion---just right.  Entree is served with white rice, soup/broth, and a tasty shredded side salad with a great Asian dressing.  

Staff was polite and attentive, food came out in a timely manner.  Have thoroughly enjoyed my experience each time.   They play nice ""Global Ambient"" music, the restaurant is somewhat small yet cozy.  It has a nice ""grown up"" simple Asian feel.  Definitely a great place to meet a significant other or good friend to lunch.  

NOT a place I would recommend for children; tables are somewhat close together and it has a relaxing feel.  Menu seemingly NOT designed with kids meals etc.  Also a bit expensive if considering price.  Hubby and I each had the Shaken Beef lunch with egg roll appetizer and drinks, it came out to $39.    Worth the money, but if you are watching budget on a lunch date, just something to consider.

"This place is so unique! I was disappointed that it was closed the weekend of my birthday in July, but I won't hold that against them!

This bar/boxing ring/vintage store/food truck/soda fountain is super awesome! My cousin took me here a few years ago and since then it's been a place that I always show friends and family members when they want to go out downtown. The drink list is pretty extensive, with lots of organic cocktails served in cute mason jars. You definitely get a good sized drink! The beers are cheap, the food is so-so. I think it's a bit overpriced, so I'd recommend eating somewhere else beforehand. 

The boxing ring is random, but I've seen friends go up there and fight in a drunken stupor, and that is a sight I'll never regret seeing. Some nights they have karaoke, which I've chosen to partake in a few times. I've seen DJ's there on the weekends, and I really like how they switch up the music genre each time.

"I've never been to the former restaurant that was once housed in this quaint little building, so my first impressions may be a bit different from others.  I have always adored this house.  It's absolutely adorable and in such a good location.  I read over the weekend that the new restaurant here was opening, so we made a point to visit it sooner rather than later.

We chose to go right after work, so there were only a few other people in here.  I really like the setup with the bar in it's own little alcove and seating situated throughout the rest of the house.  We were greeted immediately after walking in and we sat in a table by the window.  While we perused the menus I couldn't help but tap my feet to the killer old school music they were rockin'.  I ended up deciding on the grilled cheese to eat.

The food was very good.  The sourdough bread was super toasty, literally grilled to perfection.  There was a ton of cheese in the sandwich, but I don't remember which kinds.  The important thing is that it was really tasty.  My only complaint is that the cheese wasn't ooey gooey.  it was melty, but I could still make out the shape of the cheese.  In my book of grilled cheese greatness, it needs to be a little messier.  The sandwich was also served with a side of chips or salad if you choose.  The chips were good and I ate them all up.  There was also a dill pickle, but I don't do dill pickles.

I am usually toast after a half of one of the Top Shelf margaritas...and no joke, I could have passed any field sobriety test.

She was an awful waitress to begin with - although not intentionally - she just seemed to be way over her head and have some sort of short term memory problem.

She did however do what she could to make sure we left barely happy - but still charging me for $7 margaritas that I disliked was crap.

"Bottom line: the new owners bring you better beef than Al's in Chicago. Yes-they really do.

Italian food tastes better in Italy (usually). That meal on a dock in Sausalito is not the same even if you copy it exactly when you get home. Food is an experience that is altered by the location, mood, companions and results.  So, being at Al's in Scottsdale is not the same as being in Chicago...that's obvious, so get over the fact that you're stuck in North Scottsdale, and not in the Windy City. But the new owner's seem to have this place clicking. The sandwich is awesome, and they work the floor to check on your experience. They care. I read a bad review about a hambuger here...are ya nuts? Al's...ditch the burger...who cares? and customer...what the heck brought you here for a burger? Sheeesh. I digress...again.

I have always enjoyed a trip to Al's in Chicago. Portillo's, Johnny's, and don't even get me going on the Portillo's vs Al's debates, but even though Al's beef wasn't always the best quality, the combination of beef, grease, jardiniere, gravy (jus), spices, and peppers at Al's has always nailed it flavor-wise for my palate.
When I worked in Phoenix, a trip to Luke's on Indian School every few months would deliver an OK time, but it didn't really satisfy my craving for great Italian beef.
The first franchise for Al's at this location, brought those flavors I was craving, but messed up everything else about running a restaurant, and I still went back, and was sad to see them not make a go of it.

Unfortunately, that left a flavor void, and I kept waiting for new Management to get open...and just before they did, I went on a very serious training and diet regime. My latest race results and training schedule gave me a little room for coming off the regime a little, and I decided today was my perfect cheat day...I mean Al's day.

They really nailed it.
My fries were wonderful (I was eating them while they were bringing me hot sauce)....crisp, slightly browned, gooey in the middle, loaded with flavor, without being over-salted. 

The beef was absolutely great, better meat than original Al's in Chicago, as good as Portillo's in meat quality, but with all those insanely fantastic flavors I remember from my best sandwiches at Al's. Definitely one of my best sandwiches so far in 2012...and I highly suggest the ""Wet, with a side of gravy"" method.

Many may object, (oh, ye lazy masses) but, I think Al's tradition of fully-dipped sandwiches leaves you with a sodden mess, that takes the bread out of the sandwich equation. If you are indeed- lazy, well then the dipped style gives you more wet bread that has soaked up that insanely good flavor combination. So if you are lazy, and also-messy, get it dipped. But there is a better way- it just takes a little work and technique...so simple it's easily mastered by a hungry 7 year-old, but they can also fix a frozen iPhone, so....

The perfect compromise is to order the sandwich Wet, with a big side of gravy (no charge for that- thank god). You can pour large amounts of the jus into the end as you go (obviously held upright), pinching the sandwich down below your planned bite, so the jus doesn't just run through, but soaks the meat and that portion of the bread from the inside out. Lot's of the jus is what Al's beef needs to soak the meat and release that delicious flavor combination, absolutely soaking the bread too, but maintaining the sandwich integrity, while adding in a tiny little bread crunch on the outside. 

(As a caution: you can order the beef ""Dry"". My advice if that would be your choice: don't go here. This is not a sandwich that is designed to be eaten dry- the beef will be flavorless and without charm. A Roast Beef from a good deli will be awesome if that is what you are in the mood for)

""Wet, gravy on the side, sweet and hot peppers, cup of hot sauce."". Spice the gravy up with hot sauce to your taste, pinch that sandwich, and pour as you go.

Freaking awesome sandwich, that blows away the local alternatives. And I'm perfectly happy with a spotless, new interior in North Scottsdale. I don't need Chicago memorabilia or grungy atmosphere to enhance my sandwich experience when the beef is this good. Bring a few good friends, order up a few beef, try a combo with sausages, share and compare, and start your own great dining tradition. Very cool to think that I won't be jamming a daily Italian beef into every Chicago trip just because I couldn't get them anywhere else.

"I brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this Forever 21 location.  She had a bag full of goodies (several hundreds of dollars worth) from H&M.  She stopped at Forever 21 and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes.  Her H&M bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her arms.....and while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21....we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 21 staff reacted. They did not call security, or the police, or even offer any condolences.  They just shrugged their shoulders.  My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21....but the store was such a mess.  There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.  There were way too few staff members working, and many who were working were ""socializing"" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion.

"Fecking Great.    

Update:

Went for lunch:   This time I thought the corned beef taquitos even  better than last, curry chips tad saltier.  Still loving the appetizers and the cider.  This time had the  cottage pie,  it's  really nothing to write home about, specially if you are from the region and your parent's wouldn't appreciate you seeing other cottage pies;)    Spend the extra on the sheperds  it's really much better.   This was ok , really really nothing special and the heat could have been better.   Service  is good, but pedestrian , the last time I had no time pressure, this time I did.     We're sitting at 3.5 - 3.75 now with the round up till 4. Still  I'll return
 

Original Review:
 First thanks to Julie P for pointing out that this place exists. That it's within stumbling distance of the house ( think prolonged zombie stumble over an hour  versus a quick trip and recover)  is even better. 
Cider on tap is Strongbow and you get it in a real pint., Yay.  Sadly that's all they have and there's no bottled ones to try ,  Strongbow is  the Bud of UK ciders and while it's way better than no cider or what passes for beer here it's not that hard to stock more of a common drink for a themed bar. 

Onto the Food  (I'll get to it as a venue some other time)  
Appetizers.  Curry and chips was exactly what it should have been  and a generation of Irish and UK kids have  grown up with this for lunch  at the local chip shop.   
 
The  corned beef and cabbage taquitos  I think  are moving up to be our #1 appetizer that's not a hot wing. Taste of these  and the hot mustart / tomatillo salsa on the base compliment each other nicely. Not heavy on the fat and delightfully  crunchy.  For once an Irish restaurant trying to do something other than name US staples with cute regional names. 

Main: Salad   and the sheperd's pie. Let's not get into the salad it's a waste of time reviewing vegetables.  The pie is pretty good and none of the flavours overwhelm each other. Not sure the champ ( mashed potatos ) atop them live up to what lies below but it's more a personal texture issue than it spoiled the overall dish.  

Bread and Butter pudding is really good but please if you have any trouble sleeping after reading nutrition sheets as to the fat and carb content of your meal DON'T just  eat it and run round the  block four times before getting back in the car. 

Oddity?    parsley flakes on all the plates to make it green , please just buy green speckled plates , it's classier:D  At the end got a coupon for 25% off the next bill which I will certainly take them up on. It's as good  for food as any of the valley's Irish bars ( better imho)  but have to get back on pub quiz night  to really know.

Were in too early to hear the band but you can look at the pa, the space and  know it's going to sound  bad ( place looks like standing wave city)  with anything electric and full drum set.

"One of the WORST experiences of my life.  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought, ""hey wow, this is kinda cool"" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had ""cottage cheese"" legs and thighs.  We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us ""you either pay or i come over the counter"" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways, don't go here.  

Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard, are crap.  All in all, if you're a lonely loser, this is the place for you.

"This restaurant is in my TOP-5 favorite restaurants of all-time!  ...The only reason I am not giving it 5-stars is because it is a real splurge, and it takes a pretty special occasion (and experience) to justify such an expensive meal.

While in my personal experience at Posh, the quality (and ""deliciousness"") of the food I had definitely justifies the price-tag, it should - if the quality wasn't extraordinary, it wouldn't rank at all.

You really do have to be an open-minded, mostly omnivorous eater to fully appreciate it though.  If there are ingredients or flavors that you don't much care for, it might be more challenging to assume that you will like everything you get.  

It can be daunting, because you may get something that you don't like, but that is also part of the excitement (and the adventure of trying new things!)  You also may get something that you've never had done well before and find that you are a newly converted fan.  

Also, though the wine parings are wonderful, if you are on a budget, skipping the wine is a good way to trim the bill.

"Ok here is the deal with Red Devil Pizza.  The key to making pizza with crispy crust is to have ovens that great sufficiently hot.  That is why I like places with brick over pizza's. They don't use Brick Ovens at Red Devil but  I have been told that Red Devil has some really old pizza ovens that are not available any longer or hard to get.  I can't verify that, I don't even remember who told me that, maybe I read it some where.  Don't know if it is true or not. What I do know is that Red Devil is one of my favorite pizza place in the Valley.  Their pizza is consistently good.  Thin-Crisp and delicious.  I have had pasta's and salads there as well. They are fine, nothing to get excited about. But the Pizza at Red Devil is something I will stake my reputation on.

"For a pretty yuppie place, Desert Ridge has a decent enough assortment of shops, assuming of course you can find them.  Sure, you can theoretically pick up some new accents for your living room, a new pair of shoes, some books and the materials to make new candle rings in one go after which you involve yourself with movies and a beer, but you may give up in frustration before you ever find a place to park.

I dearly hope whoever laid this place out is no longer in charge of such projects.  There is no logic whatsoever to the layout.  Trying to drive between the lots can verge on nightmarish.  Needlessly huge islands in the parking lot put leaves in the way of ever finding what's across the way, so navigating the place on foot is often out of the question without even taking the Phoenix summer heat and wretched drivers into consideration.

Desert Ridge probably isn't going anywhere.  I've never been there that it wasn't busy.  It's almost impossible to avoid if you have any significant shopping to do.  But, the restaurants here don't tend to last long.

Pulled (sliced) Beef  : Meh., Meat had been a good cut but was dried out and a bit tough, Again the sauce was just OK. 

Beef Ribs : Tasty , Large & Meaty, Sauce was again... OK.

Mac. & Cheese : Most disappointing item of the meal!, Tasted like Kraft out 'o the box. 

Greens : This was the best part of my meal, Cooked appropriately and spiced very well.

Banana Pudding - Ick!!, It was partially frozen and watery, The cookies were a soggy & watery mush.

"There's no doubt about it, both Mamma Mia locations deliver some great pizza on the cheap. This Mamma Mia is now the closer of the two to my house, and at first I was a little worried. I wasn't sure if both locations were going to be good, but I'm not worried anymore.

Whenever I go there, I get slices. I also usually only spend about $6. To me, that's awesome when I'm craving some pizza pie. By the way, Mamma Mia serves good ol' fashoined NY-style pizza. Their toppings range from traditional (roni, sausage, veggies) to fancy (salmon, bleu cheese, capers). I have been known to order capers on my slices (and they were actually really good). Normally I ask for the slices well done, and I'd recommend you do the same if you like that extra bit of crispiness like me. The slices come out relatively quickly, and I've never been dissatisfied with what I've been given.

I've yet to try their sandwiches or pastas, but in time I'm sure I'll get around to it. At $6 or less a pop, I feel like I've got a good thing going.

"We've got another first timer here...!

I am just as shocked as the next person that after many years in Seattle, I had never had Bubble Tea.  Gasp!  You can get it almost as readily as Starbucks.  I learned it's also called Boba and maybe one other name.  It's all the same to me.  Same-same.

I had my first boba initiation at the recent Office Hours with Gabi.  I was completely overwhelmed by the options presented to me: what type of chewies (for the record, that term just doesn't seem right), base drink, optional flavorings, etc.  It was a lot for this gal to handle.  Luckily, Alica B. was at my side leading me down the boba path.  

She helped me pick out a concoction of Thai iced tea and regular boba.  Gotta start with the original boba, right?  She ended up with a coffee drink with coffee jellies.  I feel like I'm now ""in the know"" because she asked for the coffee jellies and even though they weren't on the menu, they indeed had them.  That's a little insider's tip from me to you.  Wink wink.  She was so excited I thought she was going to consider this woman the Patron Saint of Boba and commence worship on the spot.

I was surprised to find how incredibly filling boba is.  I wasn't hungry for hours!  Overall, it was good.  I don't see myself craving boba, but if someone wants to go, then I'm in.

Things I do not love: 
Service. Are you a bouncer? A bartender? Are you leading me to a seat? can you get me a seat? Its confusing. The staff is not clearly defined (not only do they not wear uniforms, or name tags, but they are scarce and hard to find)

"I've lived at Mark Taylor properties for about five or six years now and I have to say, they have declined greatly in the last few years.

The decor reminded my boyfriend of nightclub scene from Scarface. 

When they sat us down initially we were right next to the kitchen which wasn't too pleasant. So we asked to be moved to another location and the hostess moved us into their private dinning room which we loved. 

Our server was very friendly and informative, yet also gave us space. We ordered crab cakes to start things off. They were excellent but slightly over priced given the portion size. Then we ordered a bottle of wine that was very reasonably priced and to our liking for $24 - a nice Argentinian Malbec. We decided on this bottle after our server brought us several other tastes. I ordered the soup of the day and my boyfriend got a caesar salad. Both were solid. For entrees I got a salmon with asparagus and my boyfriend ordered seared ahi tuna. Both were cooked to perfection.

We got a refill on our drinks and the guy poured sum of our drinks on the left overs so we could not take our food back to the hotel. Foodnet Work shame on you for recommending this place. Just because the chicken is good, does not mean you treat people like shit. 

We had to remind the staff over six times to get our order. We waited over 40 minutes to get the other 3 pieces of chicken to finish our meal. We don't mind waiting but it was pretty rude when you are watching other peolple are getting their meals when they walked in after us. The Mac and Cheese did not look like everyone else's order- it look like it came out of a box. You can tell it was far from homemade, it cleary was not bake, no crust. The gravy was watered, missing favor. Corn bread was over cooked under salted. The cornbread sure as  hell did not look like everyones else's cornbread. I felt like we received the leftovers. 

Truly the worst service we ever received. The place needs to learn how to be respectful and just be nice.",came novemb servic worst ever seen treat like shit came town la vega nfl game seen mr white cafe foodnet work knew food great chicken great custom servic never return got refil drink guy pour sum drink left over could take food back hotel foodnet work shame recommend place chicken good mean treat peopl like shit remind staff six time get order wait minut get piec chicken finish meal mind wait pretti rude watch peolpl get meal walk us mac chees look like everyon els order look like came box tell far homemad cleari bake crust gravi water miss favor corn bread cook salt cornbread sure hell look like everyon els cornbread felt like receiv leftov truli worst servic ever receiv place need learn respect nice,1
"Dear fellow Singaporeans, make sure whatever you shop, be extra more careful. Although products are cheap, quality sometimes very 👎👎 And when you ask for a refund, the seller will say , you are not reasonable ,and when you want to cancelled the order, they will try to find ways , and the order will still be on its way to you, although u already cancelled it n demand refund. And Shopee does not help much. They will asked you to email/call/ explain/ sent photos to Shopee , investigate further n etc. which frankly speaking, it does not help.

"Well it's about time that I yelped about something already, it's been forever since I have! 

Got here on my lunch break, and find it surprisingly similar to the mongolian grills that I've tried back in CA.. piling on the meats, veggies, sauces and such.

"I am not in love with this place nor do I despise it.

I am Mr. Middle-of-the Road with Stacy's.

Somethings he does very well, others are just so-so.

Here are the Do's and Don'ts-

DO-Order a sweet potato pie to go. That happens to rock the house!
Have the pulled pork sandwich. Solid sandwich.

DONT--Do not and I mean DO NOT order the chicken BBQ sandwich. I ordered this a couple months ago and I could have used the shredded chicken as toothpicks. They were hard and came served in a weird cone-like shape on the bun. Also, skip the sweet potato fries. They are dry and taste like dirt. Yep, I said it. Sorry Stacy. Back to the drawing board on those.

The sauce is everything at a BBQ joint and his is just OK. Actually, I have had better in a store-bought bottle from AJs.

If you are in the area, go for it. If you live out in Glendale, it's probably not worth the drive. I am not sure what Bon Appetite was thinking when they gave this one of the top 10 new BBQ joints of 2009.

"My hubby and I have been fans of Roy's since our first time at the flagship location on Oahu . . . and we've watched him expand to the mainland. Our experience with the mainland Roy's have been hit and miss, but the Marriott Desert Ridge location pretty much knocks it out of the park! We went at the tail end of Arizona Restaurant Week. We really liked the menu options for this special week, and the warm chocolate souffle cake is always out of this world . . . If that was the only thing that tasted good, then we would feel we got our money's worth . . . but we didn't have to worry about it because everything was perfect from beginning to end.

We had an adorable server who had a great personality and excellent people skills. She was unassuming and let us linger between courses. As I am a stickler about food coming out too soon after just finishing one course, this was just perfect! And so relaxing. The ambiance on the patio, which is where we chose to sit, almost felt as if we were on one of the islands, not in the middle of the desert . . . with the tiki torches lit and the sound of the babbling water features throughout the resort, it came pretty close . . . it was just missing the trade winds.  The resort had a band playing as well . . . they were pretty good, a few ups and downs. I would have loved if the music was a little more subtle than the pop-jazz mix they were playing . . . oh, but I have digressed. 

My hubby and his daughter chose the restaurant week menu. Hubby had the Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs Smoked & Glazed in Roy's Original Mongolian Sauce. A bit cliche, but they were finger lickin' good! My step-daughter and I shared the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi Beurre Blanc -- it was huge and almost a meal. The rolls were fresh, crunchy, and had a little kick . . . not too spicy. It was a good thing I agreed to help her with it! For entrees, my hubby had the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi with Spicy Soy Mustard Butter Sauce. It, too, was an ample portion of tender ahi that was complimented by the sauce but no overpowered by it. My step-daughter had the Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi with Maine Lobster Essence. Another nice portion of perfectly cooked Mahi.  We all were starting to feel the aloha spirit . . . I had to be the exception by ordering off the regular menu and chose my most favorite entree of all . . . the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish . . . Aah, what a delight, so melt-in-your-mouth delicate . . . I was in island heaven.

Desserts were total home runs -- the melting hot chocolate souffle is mandatory for any chocolate lover. In fact, it tastes the same at every Roy's we've been to . . . it never disappoints. A total surprise . . . and a delightful one . . . was the chocolate coconut cheesecake which came with a side of mango sorbet . . . or did she say it was pineapple sorbet . . . whatever . . . it was the perfect accompaniment to the light and fluffy cheesecake.

We also ordered a bottle of Newton claret which was a modestly priced wine and as my husband said as he swirled and sipped it . . . ""I know my wines . . . "" Having to always be the exception, I ordered the he Original Hawaiian Martini, which was what I considered my dessert. It was a juicy combination of Maui pineapple, vodka and coconut rumMMMMM!

It was truly a beautiful evening from start to finish. You may be asking why I didn't give it five stars then if there were no misfires . . . that five star is reserved for Roy's Hawaiian restaurants that really do create the aloha experience with some special touches only that can only be enjoyed there!",hubbi fan roy sinc first flagship locat oahu watch expand mainland experi mainland roy hit miss marriott desert ridg locat pretti much knock park went tail end arizona restaur week realli like menu option special week warm chocol souffl cake alway world tast good would feel got money worth worri everyth perfect begin end ador server great person excel peopl skill unassum let us linger cours stickler food come soon finish cours perfect relax ambianc patio chose sit almost felt island middl desert tiki torch lit sound babbl water featur throughout resort came pretti close miss trade wind resort band play well pretti good up down would love music littl subtl pop jazz mix play oh digress hubbi daughter chose restaur week menu hubbi grill szechuan spice pork rib smoke glaze roy origin mongolian sauc bit clich finger lickin good step daughter share crispi spici ahi sushi roll ginger wasabi beurr blanc huge almost meal roll fresh crunchi littl kick spici good agre help entre hubbi roy origin hawaiian blacken island ahi spici soy mustard butter sauc ampl portion tender ahi compliment sauc overpow step daughter roy roast macadamia nut crust mahi mahi main lobster essenc anoth nice portion perfectli cook mahi start feel aloha spirit except order regular menu chose favorit entre hawaiian style misoyaki butterfish aah delight melt mouth delic island heaven dessert total home run melt hot chocol souffl mandatori chocol lover fact tast everi roy never disappoint total surpris delight chocol coconut cheesecak came side mango sorbet say pineappl sorbet whatev perfect accompani light fluffi cheesecak also order bottl newton claret modestli price wine husband said swirl sip know wine alway except order origin hawaiian martini consid dessert juici combin maui pineappl vodka coconut rummmmmm truli beauti even start finish may ask give five star misfir five star reserv roy hawaiian restaur realli creat aloha experi special touch enjoy,0

I've tried everything on the menu, but my favorite options are the Crab Wontons and the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken. I ordered these plus the Spicy Korean for my n00b boyfriend to try, and everything went better than expected.

"OK ok ok.  I'll have to agree with some of the below reviewers that this place isn't dead-on authentic Mexican food.  That being said, I love it!  The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.  

The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.  

The food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.

I guess when it comes down to it, I'm an atmosphere buff.

"Yes, the view is wonderful. Absolutely. 

Sadly, my table was near the entrance, limiting my ability to enjoy said view. Also, we are still in the summer months, so I was confused that there was a fire raging outside at night. 

The decor is wonderful, dark with different tones and moods. We arrived in the early evening, so I was surprised to see how dark the room would eventually become. I didn't find the table and its decor that exciting, but it will give it a pass. Not everything has to be practical art.

Our party consisted of five and we were certainly treated to a good sampling of what this place had to offer. Half of the party ordered off of the set price menu. This included a three course meal for something like fifty dollars. It may have even been less than that, but I'm not sure. This menu had an array of choices and wasn't limited to chicken or pork. 

I was impressed with the portions and the quality. The salads were crisp and the dressing wasn't overpowering, more of an accent, the way it should be. The meat was tender and flavorful; our table ordered the NY, Ribeye and Salmon. I do agree with others who said that the sides were a little small, but I do think they were worth the price. I know for sure the cream of corn was, as it was treated with green chili and a bit of spice. 

The desert was alright. Not a great deal of variety. The textures were spot on, but the temperatures seems a bit off. If a dish was intended to be served warm, it was slightly too cold, etc.

The service was bad. Probably the worst service I've had at any restaurant. Our server left items off of the tab, forcing her to return and run the debit card three separate times. I am okay with someone making a mistake, but it should not take two attempts to correct. Also, my wife and I ordered Mojitos. They were very average. No sugar, which I assumed was standard fare for Mojiots, and amount of mint was rather low. I understand that drinks are open to a bartender's whim, so I won't dwell on this fact.

Valet had a bit of trouble with our car and keys, which was annoying.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience, food and atmosphere alike.

"eewh! yuck and wtf!?

This Barnes & Noble Book Store sucks for sitting back, relaxing and trying to read. I know it is not a library, and I don't expect it to be. But, come on - you can at least have some sense of trying to keep the noise level down and have some cozy seating. 

And... Yikes! The people here are gross. They had some couch-chairs to lounge in and they were - in all of their grossness. And they were reading magazines of all things. WTF buy it and go home and let your kids do kart wheels there. EEWH!

Then, those of us who actually purchased books and were trying to peacefully read them were in the cafe' - sitting on their dirty wooden benches - where I guess the servers there think that part of theirs jobs in serving coffee is to do a drum solo every time they empty the used coffee grinds into the trash can - which was about every 5 minutes. Yeesh! Luckily, I had my iPod. It was blasting and I still could hear them banging away. It was not a very cleanly area either. 

I was going to ask if they had wifi but I just high-tailed it out of there instead. This place is small too and their book selection is limited.

I have been looking for a place to go to read, work and drink some coffee in my area (Arrowhead) and this one is definitely crossed off of my list. 

Come here to try and find a book but don't come expecting to kick back and enjoy your novel or what have you. If you like people watching though, this may be your place. There are all kinds here.

"Hippies scare me.     So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy, which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.

It was all for nothing. No hippies around, just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6"" could easily eat off of them.  

Anyways for $5 flat, you get a kick ass burger, a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries, and a can of soda.   It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.

I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say ""it's organic, don't panic"".

I found this store to be a little bit of a walking contradiction.(okay, not ""walking"" but you dig what I'm saying)

"Went last night to Whore Foods to get basics to make pizza with, most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast. Low and behold, the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didn't put something in the bag.

And this time it was the yeast.

I love the food there, but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from Scottsdale who can't be bothered to do their goddamn jobs! I am so sick of this crap with this corporation. Maybe its a Phoenix thing, or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of Whore Foods, but I am done shopping at any Whore Foods. In a place like Phoenix, where you have alternatives such as Sprouts, you'd think Whore Foods would smarten up.

Or when you try to ask someone who works here where something is, and they just walk by with their nose high in the air.

"Great new addition to Mill Ave. 

First stopped by here for a Monday Happy Hour, and instantly loved it. This is a perfect day-drinking place when the weather is nice, and they do a good job of creating a large indoor / outdoor space with plenty of patio. Happy Hour is pretty great - 1/2 off almost all beers. (they do well drink / wine specials too, but don't remember what they were. I think it was $1 off... but don't quote me on that.) Bottom line, I had 3 Firestone DBAs, and i think my bill was about 8 bucks before tip. Score. (normal beer prices are in the $5-6 range. A vodka gimlet not on happy hour (well vodka) cost me $4, which is right where it should be.)

Also made a return trip on a Saturday night, to get a feel for the weekend crowd. Not too bad, but mildly disappointed. I was hoping it would remain a little more of the chill day-time vibe, but come 10pm the music gets cranked up, and my group decided to move on to a place where we could actually have conversation without screaming. 

(sidenote: every bartender / waitress I've dealt with here has been really, super nice.)

"¡CASH ONLY! But so worth it.

I have been  a regular at this place for the past 10 years. I am Mexican and for me this is the most authentic ""Cenaduría"" in Phoenix. 

The food is authentic. They use the white Mexican cheese is used in Mexico. In Mexico cheddar cheese is not used on top of tacos or tostadas. Prices are very affordable. The ladies that take your order at the front desk had been there for at least 10 years and are very kind. 

Restrooms are always clean and this is so important to me. If a restaurant does not have the time to maintain its restrooms clean then I can not trust them in the food being clean.

The cons......BRING CASH! no credit cards are accepted. Also, they do not have the best control over flies. I always have a fly somewhere around my table. I think it has to be with no AC. They have some kind of cooler and fans. And they can have the Tv and the jukebox playing at the same time which is annoying. 

The good news is that you can always take the food out.

"Dined here last Friday night.  I know this is considered one of the better Chinese restaurants, but I am struggling w/ a 2 vs 3 star rating.

The eggrolls, pot stickers were good.  Pot stickers are actually quite stuffed.

I got one of the chow mein dishes w/ the noodles done Hong Kong style, fried.  The dish itself was fine, but the noodles were weird.  Part of them looked like they had not been put in oil and fried adequately...they were dried and stiff.  I pulled that bit out onto my extra plate.  

The daugher liked her Kung Pao chicken.  Hubbie's shrimp dish was good too, but the broccoli ringing the dish could have been cooked just a little bit longer...it was pretty much raw.

Table was a little sticky. 

Ultimately, I felt I could go to another chinese restaurant and have a similar meal, maybe Tao would be slightly better?  Or Tao is slightly worse?  I can't get past those noodles.  Yuck.

"There are sadly a lot of negative reviews on here, so I though I would add my positive one.I had a second-generation Kindle many years ago, and it has since stopped working. I finally decided to buy a new one.I chose the basic Kindle because that's exactly what I wanted -- a bare-bones e-reader. I have no need for a tablet or anything of the sort. This Kindle delivers on that front in every way possible.At first, I thought I would miss the page turn buttons, and dislike the touch screen. However, I have been delightfully surprised. Tapping the edge of the screen to turn the page is incredibly easy and less intrusive than pushing a button, which was always a nice little jarring reminder that I wasn't, in fact, reading a paperback. The small, quick tap of my thumb on the edge of the screen has become almost like a reflex and I don't notice it anymore it feels natural.I do slightly miss the metal backing of the older Kindles it made them feel a bit sturdier, whereas this basic Kindle is just hard plastic. However, I suspect that using a metal casing would up the price considerably, and I feel that the cheaper price of this basic Kindle far outweighs that slight drawback.I bit the bullet and bought one without the special offers. I do not want ads intruding my Kindle experience, even if they only show as the screensaver or on a bar across the bottom of the Home screen. It is just distasteful to me, and the extra 30 was worth it to me to avoid the ads.I do not need or want a case for my Kindle. I do not like to read with a case on, and it would be cumbersome to remove my Kindle from its case every time I want to read.Read more",sadli lot neg review though would add posit second gener kindl mani year ago sinc stop work final decid buy new chose basic kindl exactli want bare bone e reader need anyth sort kindl deliv front everi way possibl first thought would miss page turn button dislik touch screen howev delight surpris tap edg screen turn page incred easi less intrus push button alway nice littl jar remind fact read paperback small quick tap thumb edg screen becom almost like reflex notic anymor feel natur slightli miss metal back older kindl made feel bit sturdier wherea basic kindl hard plastic howev suspect use metal case would price consider feel cheaper price basic kindl far outweigh slight drawback bit bullet bought without special offer want ad intrud kindl experi even show screensav bar across bottom home screen distast extra worth avoid ad need want case kindl like case would cumbersom remov kindl case everi want,1

"We had a pretty darn good time.

Decided to take my two nieces to the festival.  Our total cost for 3 of us w/ 2 bracelets before food and extras was $64 - and the girls got on almost every ride, even the big, scary ones!  We went on a Friday at 4ish and the crowd was perfect and relaxed.. absolutely no lines.  Come 6pm, though, that all changed.  The lines got big and it started to not matter to get our bracelets worth of rides for the wait in line (plus the cold night air!).  Also, come 6pm, it just got plain ridiculous with all these little high school kids wearing skimpy clothes and making out and talking bad (where are these kid's parents!?!.. who raised these kids!?!).. it got annoying real quick.

The shows:
- Ostrich Race at 6pm was good - kinda funny, but not that entertaining
- Monkey Show at 9pm was AWESOME - I saw this show last year when we went with the in-laws and I *still* laughed my butt off (easily amused maybe?)
- Petting Zoo - LOVE this.. they had a lot of baby goats (my fave!) and the animals were never menacing and actually very docile.
- In the past I saw the trapeze show and it was entertaining, though the motorcycles in the metal sphere was quite impressive and very entertaining

Overall, the price was decent for the entertainment and the rides the gals got to enjoy; the food was typical fair food (FYI, DO shop around.. prices change across similar products by 2-3$ sometimes, so feel free to shop around for water bottles and other food staples); the staff running the rides were decent people (not creepy, which can be the status quo); the ambiance is good (not OVERLY ghetto) but caution that after 7pm, it gets more crowded with high school kids.. so more lines and more stupid conversations you get to listen to.. yay!",pretti darn good decid take two niec festiv total cost us w bracelet food extra girl got almost everi ride even big scari one went friday ish crowd perfect relax absolut line come pm though chang line got big start matter get bracelet worth ride wait line plu cold night air also come pm got plain ridicul littl high school kid wear skimpi cloth make talk kid parent rais kid got annoy real quick show ostrich race pm good kinda funni entertain monkey show pm awesom saw show last year went law still laugh butt easili amus mayb pet zoo love lot babi goat fave anim never menac actual docil past saw trapez show entertain though motorcycl metal sphere quit impress entertain overal price decent entertain ride gal got enjoy food typic fair food fyi shop around price chang across similar product sometim feel free shop around water bottl food stapl staff run ride decent peopl creepi statu quo ambianc good overli ghetto caution pm get crowd high school kid line stupid convers get listen yay,0

"I had lunch here the other day.  It was a bit before the noon lunch rush so it wasn't too crowded.  You could tell they were gearing up for it so I can tell they get pretty busy.  So come early to avoid waiting with throngs of school kids that undoubtedly come from the high school next door.  

I like that their menu isn't huge with zillions of burger combos and other options.  It was pretty straight forward.  I had the standard burger, fries and a drink.  Everything looks like it is pretty much cooked to order so it took a few minutes to get my food which was ok.  The cashier guy who looked suspiciously like Ray Liotta was very friendly and working like crazy so I'm pretty sure he was the manager if not the owner.

The burger was thick, juicy and cooked perfectly.  It was a tad bit greasy but that made it that much more delicious.  The fries were also pretty good.  They are crinkle cut with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and fluffiness on the inside.  I wasn't exactly sure what to do with the little cup of sauce they give you so I used it for my fries and my burger.  I think it was some chipotle mayo stuff.  It was pretty good but an odd thing to put on burgers and/or fries.

Style without substance can be summed up in their cheese plate: pineapple, melon, grapes, herbed chevre, Babybel minis (they even leave the wax on for ya) and cubes of pepper jack and colby jack served with sesame crackers.  I can't make this gold up.  

They serve a lot of ""martinis"" as the name implies, very few of which actually contains the ingredients for a proper martini.  But then again, now that I've described the cheese plate, this should come as no surprise.

"So Wednesday evening I needed milk and cat food. On my way to the store I realized my stomach was growling. Never a good idea to shop on an empty stomach. A while back in The Savvy Shopper rag in the China Grill ad was a little banner about Wok n Stix being a new location. And because of an event that fell apart this week I had a bug to eat something Asian. So I found it and stopped in.

Chinese fast food. They also have hamburgers and a few other things. I stuck with something I figured I would like, orange chicken ($7.95). It came reasonably quick, was too hot to eat right away. Most of my Chinese fast food consists of Panda Express and Ming Gee. This was much better, in addition to the onions and bell peppers listed mine had mushrooms, celery, sprouts and some other stuff. Service was on styrofoam with plastic utensils. Even though I was eating in the rice came in a take out box which I thought was sorta weird. I still hate eating out alone but at least I wasn't the only person in the place. Each side of the place had a long upholstered bench with tables and chairs that could be slid along to make up different seating and two tables in the middle.

There was nobody being served at the front counter when I was finished so I stopped,picked up a menu and talked to the woman there and found out she is an owner. They have had the place for 6 months and are the same family that owns China Grill not far away.",wednesday even need milk cat food way store realiz stomach growl never good idea shop empti stomach back savvi shopper rag china grill ad littl banner wok n stix new locat event fell apart week bug eat someth asian found stop chines fast food also hamburg thing stuck someth figur would like orang chicken came reason quick hot eat right away chines fast food consist panda express ming gee much better addit onion bell pepper list mine mushroom celeri sprout stuff servic styrofoam plastic utensil even though eat rice came take box thought sorta weird still hate eat alon least person place side place long upholst bench tabl chair could slid along make differ seat two tabl middl nobodi serv front counter finish stop pick menu talk woman found owner place month famili own china grill far away,1

I ordered the Vampiro because it sounded good, had guac, carne asada, and was portrayed as a quesadilla type meal.  Ya, this thing was like the size of a Kennedy half dollar - and half as filling!  What the hell? $4 for this?  I can't even taste the guac!!

"I'm sorry to be what seems to be the lone one star review.  Either I got there on the worst day in their history, or everyone drank the Koolaid, or I just have different expectations and taste buds.
It seems like a great idea.  It's a build your own burger joint, $7.00 gets you a cooked to order burger with one cheese, up to 4 toppings, and 2 sauces with fries or onion rings-or some other choices.  They also claim that the beef is local, hormone free, etcetera....

I chose a rare burger with American, grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms. tomato and lettuce, with mayo and mustard on a potato bun.  I added bacon for a dollar.

First, let me point out that if you are in a hurry, DON'T GO HERE TO EAT.  I waited exactly 39 minutes for my food. This would not be a big deal if:
1.  I had been warned before they ran my credit card--what if I only had 30 minutes for lunch??
2. They had places to sit but it's tiny and full.
3.  They had magazines, a jukebox, ANYTHING to entertain you for 39 minutes.  You can't even get your drink early to sip on that.

At the 30 minute mark, I'm ready to eat cardboard with a little ketchup on it, so maybe they make you wait so everything tastes even better?
Anyway, before my burger comes up, I notice that the lady behind the counter is saying that the orders overwhelmed the kitchen.  I look in the kitchen---they have ONE GUY TRYING TO DO ALL THIS??????   He'd better be getting a share of the profits!!!!!  Now I'm jsut feeling really bad for this guy back there.

I finally get my burger!  YAY!!  I'm SO excited!  All those 4 and 5 star reviews!  I take a bite and....the patty shoots out the other side of the bun like it had been shot out of a cannon.
WTH?  I look at the patty.  It's clean as a whistle. I mean there is no mayo or mustard or cheese smeared on the patty.  I turn it over and it slides out of my fingers back into the basket.  The other side is clean too.  The freakin' burger was so greasy, it slid all over the place!  Then a greasy glop of what must have  been the mushrooms and onions slid out.  Still not seeing any cheese, mayo, or mustard anywhere.  Just oil.  Tons and tons of oil.  I open the bun,  On one side is a heavily oiled slick of lettuce glued to the bun by (I am guessing) a slice of cheese.  The other side of the bun has some mayo and mustard residue--and more oil.  I'm grossed out, but hungry.  I take a bite.  It's not rare,  It's well done and oddly, tastes very faintly of liver.  BTW, remember the bacon I paid a dollar for?  Not there.  I'm really puzzled that instead of cheese. or beef, or SOMETHING, I just taste that faint livery taste. So I take another bite.There isn't even any salt or pepper, or anything on the burger patty.  This is perhaps, the worst grade of meat available for human consumption.  I take a third bite because that second bite brought back a memory of when I worked for a meat company here in town.  Now I recognize the flavor.  I'm not saying that what I ate that day at Two Hippies was old dairy cow, but that's EXACTLY what it tasted like.

At this point, I turn to the fries.  The are shriveled and DARK and taste like they've been fried and then microwaved.

I couldn't get out of there fast enough!  Forget my danged dollar!  just get me in the car!

Exactly one hour and 20 minutes later, I had vicious diarrhea

"Phoenix is lacking in good Indian restaurants, and that is compounded if you're in the mood for South Indian food. Cafe Krishna is a perfect example. I would come here again on occasion only because I often crave South Indian and there are no superior alternatives. 

I ordered the sambar-vada. The vada was not as hearty or flavorful as I would ordinarily expect. It was also served somewhat lukewarm. The chutneys were mediocre. The vada was a bit too soft for my liking. Dosa is harder to screw up, so I enjoyed that a bit more, but still nothing out of this world. 

The service was poor, unprofessional and a bit chaotic. The environment and atmosphere were good.

"I've been here twice...the first time was driven by a rumor that they made their own root beer.  I'm a sucker for homemade root beer, so I had high hopes that this place would become a favorite.  My husband and I were so excited when these huge glasses of RB hit the table!!  And then confusion...both of us looked at each other and said ""WTF???""  Worst RB EVER!

What the heck was in this drink that made it taste like ass?  We looked all over the menu and found nothing.  Then we saw the ""fine print"" on a small table sign...STEVIA.  It's made with Stevia NOT sugar...I'm sorry, but I have to say that this is the lame-est root beer on the planet.  If I'm going to treat myself to a big glass of homemade root beer, I want it to be delectable...sugar and all...no freaking high fructose corn syrup and no bloody artificial sugars (and yes, I know stevia is ""natural"" but who gives a crap...it tastes terrible anyway).

After the root beer debacle, it didn't get better.  The food was meh...service was not so great (there were moments of ""is she ever coming back???"").

"Carmel Bianca!!! Oh my Effin Gosh... that's the stuff! It's yum. I'm a fan of white chocolate flavored coffee so maybe I'm bias and why I simply enjoyed my 16oz of Carmel Bianca goodness.

Thanks to Yelp I decided last night after a driving lesson with L that I was too tired to drive home without something to pick me up... and that was reason enough to make the short trek to Dolce because I've always wanted to try it. Wasn't exactly sure where it was, and happy to find that it's just across from Padre's next to a Psychic place. Dolce has a cool vibe with music videos playing. And they're good songs too... like I had never seen Pitbull's ""The Anthem"" video... liked it! Enjoyed my Carmel Bianca with a slice of their Chicago Style Cheesecake. I liked the cheesecake because it was different in taste compared to other cheesecakes, it was like a marzipan with cheese frosting on top... so it was interesting. Not really a fan of the German Choc that my friends K and D got. I thought it was dry... yuck! 

It's a small place that's bright, with four flat screens spread about. The owner, Cesar (I think) was a sweetheart! I just hope Dolce survives as a 24 hour cafe on weekends because this place has potential. It's way better than counterculture cafe back in the day. This is like the best place to go after the bars if you need a pick me up before heading home to the eastside from central Phoenix. Prices are moderate.

"The Amazon Tap is a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. You can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more.It contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands. It also has Dolby stereo speakers for playing music. The Amazon Tap is basically the portable version of the popular Amazon Echo that was released last year.Ive been testing the Tap for several days now. Heres what I think so far: What I Like I find that the Tap understands my verbal commands accurately. This could be due to the fact that, since its button activated, Im always very close to the device when I speak to it. Nevertheless, its nice that Tap understands me the first time. This was my experience with the Amazon Echo as well.The audio is surprisingly good for such a small device. I test portable speakers all the time and Id say the Amazon Tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range. Don't expect Bose type sound or deep bass levels, however.No other portable speaker device offers voice control and Wi-Fi streaming. Thus the Amazon Tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers. This is especially true if you already have Amazon Prime and Prime Music.It supports many great services. Like the Amazon Echo that came before it, the Amazon Tap supports popular music services such as Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.Battery life has been good so far. I used it off and on for a couple days without charging it. Ill post an update once I have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life.Read more",tap portabl bluetooth speaker control voic instruct play music order product servic control home autom product connect devic plu whole lot contain button activ microphon listen verbal command also dolbi stereo speaker play music tap basic portabl version popular echo releas last year ive test tap sever day here think far like find tap understand verbal command accur could due fact sinc button activ im alway close speak nevertheless nice tap understand first experi echo well audio surprisingli good small test portabl speaker id say tap good better speaker price rang expect bose type sound deep bass level howev portabl speaker offer voic control wi fi stream thu tap offer tremend amount valu similarli price portabl speaker especi true alreadi prime prime music support mani great servic like echo came tap support popular music servic prime music spotifi pandora iheartradio tunein batteri life good far use coupl day without charg ill post updat come closer test limit batteri life,0
"""Meh. I've experienced better"" pretty much sums up my experience here tonight.
 
I have a sneaking suspicion that this is the go-to sushi place for people who either
 A) don't know anything about good sushi or
 B) have no taste buds and money burning a hole in their pocket

I didn't really know what to expect from this place before we arrived. I'd never heard of it before and the only reason we agreed to go was because it was close to my boyfriends house and our friend said it was pretty reasonable in price and quality of food.
My boyfriend and I arrived before our friends and we walked to in an almost completely deserted restaurant. There was some really bad techno remixes of popular songs playing in the background and an episode of Dr. Phil on the television. I sat down in one of their ridiculously tall bar chairs while my boyfriend went to grab us a menu we could look over while waiting for our friends to arrive. 
Most. Uncomfortable. Chairs. Ever! 
I couldn't have been sitting in it longer than a couple of mins before I had to get up out of it. The seat had an aluminum bar or something all the way around it that dug into my leg after sitting down. It's hard to describe how or why they were so uncomfortable, but if you've been here before you know what I mean. They clearly chose these chairs based on aesthetics alone. 
Anyway, our friends arrived and we all ordered our food. I decided on getting the ultimate salmon roll and I believe it was called the sun roll. I could be wrong on the name of that second one but it was something close to that. My boyfriend got a couple rolls and we decided to share a plate of tuna sashimi. For the 2 rolls I ordered and the plate of sashimi it was almost $40. My boyfriend got the sunshine roll and a las vegas roll. Those two rolls plus a drink was more than $20. So all together we spent more than $60. I love sushi. I would be more than happy to pay those prices for a plate of delicious fish. But what came out was not what I was expecting for the price we paid. 
My rolls were pretty, but they were almost inedible. I pretty much choked down the ultimate sushi roll. 2 or 3 pieces into eating it I debated wether or not it was worth finishing. The little tiny bit of smoked salmon that was inside was dry and I could barely taste the fresh salmon that was conservatively layered on top. I moved onto the whatever-sun roll and that was a little bit better but it was still lacking in flavor and texture. The sashimi was just awful. It didn't taste like fish, it almost didn't taste like anything, and the texture of it was really weird. It was almost chewy. My boyfriend and I have been known to just down entire plates of sashimi in less than a min or two, but after one piece he called it quits and it took me the entire rest of our time in the restaurant to finish the plate.
The staff was pretty nice, I mean they weren't going out of their way to be pleasant with us but they weren't rude either. 
All together I'd say this visit and the food was a total failure. I feel like this place's only saving grace is that it's clean and it's in a pretty convenient location. I would have liked to give this place another shot and try another couple of rolls before writing my review, but I was REALLY disappointed with the ""food"" (I am having a hard time even using that word because it was barely edible) I ordered. It wasn't the worst sushi in the world, but it wasn't anywhere near the best. And with the prices they're charging for these lack-luster rolls, I really don't see myself ever coming back here again.",meh experienc better pretti much sum experi tonight sneak suspicion go sushi place peopl either know anyth good sushi b tast bud money burn hole pocket realli know expect place arriv never heard reason agre go close boyfriend hous friend said pretti reason price qualiti food boyfriend arriv friend walk almost complet desert restaur realli techno remix popular song play background episod dr phil televis sat ridicul tall bar chair boyfriend went grab us menu could look wait friend arriv uncomfort chair ever sit longer coupl min get seat aluminum bar someth way around dug leg sit hard describ uncomfort know mean clearli chose chair base aesthet alon anyway friend arriv order food decid get ultim salmon roll believ call sun roll could wrong name second someth close boyfriend got coupl roll decid share plate tuna sashimi roll order plate sashimi almost boyfriend got sunshin roll la vega roll two roll plu drink togeth spent love sushi would happi pay price plate delici fish came expect price paid roll pretti almost ined pretti much choke ultim sushi roll piec eat debat wether worth finish littl tini bit smoke salmon insid dri could bare tast fresh salmon conserv layer top move onto whatev sun roll littl bit better still lack flavor textur sashimi aw tast like fish almost tast like anyth textur realli weird almost chewi boyfriend known entir plate sashimi less min two piec call quit took entir rest restaur finish plate staff pretti nice mean go way pleasant us rude either togeth say visit food total failur feel like place save grace clean pretti conveni locat would like give place anoth shot tri anoth coupl roll write review realli disappoint food hard even use word bare edibl order worst sushi world anywher near best price charg lack luster roll realli see ever come back,0
"I havne't been into Radio Milano quite as many times as I have been into Postino, but I have to say of those times I have, I was impressed. They have complimentary valet parking which in this neighborhood is a huge plus!

Their menu has many different dishes to choose from along with the daily special that always sounds great. The other night when some friends and I stopped in the special was short rib ravioli, yum right? Well, I wasn't able to fiund out, as they were sold out for the evening. I instead got the linguini with clams, and I am glad I did. One of the tastiest things I have eaten in awhile. It was with a light cream/butter sauce with garlice and leeks and clams. If you like clams I would deffinatly recomend this dish, it's perfect!

They also have some interesting things on the menu you I am excited to try next time I stop in; deviled eggs, olive oil cake, and their mac 'n cheese.

Their wine list was nice, decently priced as well. Radio Milano has a warm cozy inviting feel, anyone can have a good time. Just be mindfull that it is an open room, and talking to your neighbor as if you were at a football game is not the most polite thing to do. I wish the ladies that were out for a batchlorette party that night could have gotten the memo, ""they were loud"" is an understatment.

With its bare white walls and sparse attempts at decor, this place is overly and unreasonably obnoxious. Despite not being crowded, and there never being more than one person in front of me each time, I had to wait on line.  With two people working behind the counter there's no reason to forget my order or make me wait 5+ minutes each time I needed something (to get my coffee, to ask for the Internet password, and then to remind them that I ordered coffee). Unfortunately the coffee supplied was  mediocre as best. Disruptive music selection that was too damn loud. Annoying..thank God for pandora.com, a good set of ear-bud, and reasonable wi-fi or I never would have gotten any work done.

The only reason I'd come back here is if my son had another concert to attend nearby.

*  The ""G Red"" blended red wine didn't suck.  

*  The Ham and Eggs:  Deviled eggs were quite tasty.  The ham was medium-thickly sliced and put on a stick.  Nicely warmed.  How could you possibly f up ham?

*  Grilled cheese and tomato soup:  Both quite delicious.

* Cheese plate:  Three cheeses with toasted almonds, crackers, dried apricot and apple half.  I've had better cheese.  Not the greatest selections.  Could stand to include a nice blue.

0 stars for the service, or lack there of.  My business partner and I were in town for a convention.  We heard we should check out Lola.  So we did.  We were excited.  The lady (I use the term loosely here) who took our order was LESS than patient OR helpful.  We asked a few questions.  She barely answered us, then when we had to repeat the question she was nothing short of annoyed.  An example.  We asked where we could get a glass or cup of water.  She mumbled something about the bar/table.  My partner walked over and saw no cups.  She came back and asked where the cups were.  On the table came an exasperated retort.  I walked over to inspect for myself.  There were no cups on the table.  So I kindly asked her if the cups should be on the table, if so there appeared to be none.  She said they are on the table, but *sigh* I'll go check, but I know they're there!  10 seconds later she comes out of the kitchen with a tube of cups.  IMAGINE THAT the customer was right.  I watched this lady serve other customers.  It appears that regulars are treated with a smile and courtesy and patience.  Newcomers or people she doesn't like are treated worse than the dirt on the bottom of her shoes.

"I was initially going to give Riva's 3-stars, as they're really just like any other Filiberto's/Umberto's/Roberto's/Ernie and Berto's out there, except for a couple of small differences.

For one, everything seems to be just a little bit more fresh there.  It's probably not, but it tastes like it.  And secondly, their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there, a must for any burrito.

The California Burrito, with carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese, is a must, as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito.  But the real winner here is the Carne Asada Fries.  A metric ton of carne asada piled on top of freshly fried french fries, sour cream, cheese and guacamole for only $5?  Can't be beat, especially if you're hammered and it's 3 A.M. 

Not a classy joint, not a place you go if you're wary of stupid crap like ""health code violations"" (the best places never are), but definitely a late-night hot-spot for the Mill crowd.  Lovely.

"This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. This is the successor for last year's Kindle Fire HD but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new Mayday feature.Update: Some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the HDX. If you search on YouTube for HDX Blue Haze, you can find a video showing the issue. Amazon has updated their Learn More link with the following info:To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.As a result of using these blue LEDs, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.If this is something that you think would bother you, I'd recommend taking a look at the YouTube video or taking a look at the HDX at a local Best Buy or office superstore.

"As a vegetarian and sporadic health nut, I just love TJ's. They have a nice array of inexpensive fresh produce, including my beloved broccolini, for 40% of what Safeway charges. Huge selection of frozen veggie-friendly dinners, good for my on-the-go household. Greek yogurt, cheap. Nice beer selection with lots of cheapo wine. I try to buy all my supplements here too, as they seem to be a lot less expensive. Yes, I'm all about saving cash on groceries and whatnot.

The downside? It's not one-stop-shopping; a trip always requires supplementation with another trip to a ""regular"" grocery store. This particular TJ's is teeny-tiny-small, and always chock-full of obnoxious and/or oblivious people who wield carts like weapons.

The place was fairly dead for a Saturday night. I had always seen this place packed when passing by. Maybe we missed the rush? 
The service was nothing special. Our server had no personality and seemed bored. I ordered a pizza with pistachios, parmesan and red onions and my boyfriend ordered some kind of BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza was dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. It wasn't AWFUL, but it wasn't REMARKABLE either. We left unimpressed and don't really have any craving to go back there again.

"What is the big deal about this place?!

It's not great, but pretty good. Not bad, but ok. Just is what it is. We had some wings and a stuffed pizza, and the wings were undersized yet pretty flavorful. The pizza, I just don't understand the hype. Maybe I've had Giordano's, Gino's, and Lou Malnati's too much in Chicago but this place just wasn't it. The pizza is okay, and just okay... if nothing else, WAY too salty. After a while, I felt like I was consuming a salt lick.

Service was weird, and I'm pretty sure our server was on coke. the restaurant was PACKED and the place was buzzing and he came and sat at our table and started shooting the shit. It was very bizzare.

"Being the B, L, and D (breakfast, lunch and dinner) restaurant of a major valley resort takes allot of versatility. From scrambling eggs to grilling a piece of meat the new Rico's American Grill at the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort shows that all this can be done and more on a daily basis. 

With two massive patios, a large bar and lounge area coupled with a fantastic selection of locally made beers on tap, just beckons you to try them all out. This is easily done by ordering up a Beer Flight ($7) which gets you 4 5oz glasses of their best brews, though this will be tough to chose, they're all good. Then you can order a capped 64oz growler ($20) to go! A growler is simply a large glass jug filled with your favorite beer, your choice. These are all the rage in other cities so I was excited to see Rico's making this offer. Id fill it with my latest favorite, Left Hand Milk Stout Sweet Stout. Think rich flavors of chocolate and coffee blended with milk sugars to give a sweet and creamy taste. 

In the large dining room you'll notice a wood fired oven. Unfortunately Rico's doesn't take full advantage of this, only offering a handful of menu items cooked in it including the BBQ Chicken Flatbread ($12). Covered with pulled chicken, red onions, Rico's BBQ sauce and mozzarella, this paired well with our beers though could have used a bit more salt, easily remedied. Another glimmer of what could be was the Wood Oven Baked Penne ($13). Several large meatballs, roasted tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and pesto ricotta cheese and al dente pasta made for a hearty satisfying meal. 

A bit lighter but bold with flavor, the Chopped Salad ($10, add grilled chicken $3) made with grilled corn, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and BBQ-ranch dressing was shaken, not stirred, literally. The salad is brought out in a large martini shaker, dressing added on the spot then shaken well. Kind of a neat twist on table-side salad service, what's old is new again. 

The Wicked Meatloaf ($15) could have used some of Rico's BBQ sauce for a sweet contrast instead of the semi-boring-more-like-brown-gravy cracked pepper demi. The meaty slabs were paired up with roasted garlic mashed potatoes that were well seasoned and comforting.   

Perfectly cooked and perfectly tender, the New York Strip Steak ($21) had a warm poblano and bacon relish that I could have eaten by the spoonful. The smoky sweet relish made the need for any sort of steak sauce not necessary. Along side was a heaping helping of green chile mac 'n' cheese, so creamy and so gone, delish. 

Apple Skillet For 2 ($7) takes apple slices simmered in a brown sugar and cinnamon, thanks to the wood-burning oven, then topped with cake crumbles and served with cinnamon vanilla gelato. If the skillet weren't so hot I would have licked it clean. 

While Rico's may not have yet achieved culinary greatness, what you do get is solid Southwestern influenced American grub.",b l breakfast lunch dinner restaur major valley resort take allot versatil scrambl egg grill piec meat new rico american grill point hilton squaw peak resort show done daili basi two massiv patio larg bar loung area coupl fantast select local made beer tap beckon tri easili done order beer flight get oz glass best brew though tough chose good order cap oz growler go growler simpli larg glass jug fill favorit beer choic rage citi excit see rico make offer id fill latest favorit left hand milk stout sweet stout think rich flavor chocol coffe blend milk sugar give sweet creami tast larg dine room notic wood fire oven unfortun rico take full advantag offer hand menu cook includ bbq chicken flatbread cover pull chicken red onion rico bbq sauc mozzarella pair well beer though could use bit salt easili remedi anoth glimmer could wood oven bake penn sever larg meatbal roast tomato sauc fresh mozzarella pesto ricotta chees al dent pasta made hearti satisfi meal bit lighter bold flavor chop salad add grill chicken made grill corn black bean bacon tomato cucumb avocado bbq ranch dress shaken stir liter salad brought larg martini shaker dress ad spot shaken well kind neat twist tabl side salad servic old new wick meatloaf could use rico bbq sauc sweet contrast instead semi bore like brown gravi crack pepper demi meati slab pair roast garlic mash potato well season comfort perfectli cook perfectli tender new york strip steak warm poblano bacon relish could eaten spoon smoki sweet relish made need sort steak sauc necessari along side heap help green chile mac n chees creami gone delish appl skillet take appl slice simmer brown sugar cinnamon thank wood burn oven top cake crumbl serv cinnamon vanilla gelato skillet hot would lick clean rico may yet achiev culinari great get solid southwestern influenc american grub,0

"We went to the game against the Milwaukee Brewers on 3/25/10 and had a great time (and not just because the Dodgers won).  We arrived early enough to walk around outside the whole stadium and see the practice fields.  We even saw Tommy Lasorda, himself, outside at a table giving autographs!

Parking was free (sort of; it was included in the price of the tickets), and we were able to park close because we were early.  Traffic leaving was ""typical Frank McCourt"" style, meaning that it could have been better.  Exiting traffic was set up to force us out in the wrong direction, so it was good to have the car's GPS guide us back to the freeway.

We were surprised to see that not all of the food/drink stands were open, but I think they had only sold about 60-70% tickets for that game (Thursday 1:00 game).  There was plenty of berm (grass) seating.  We had splurged for premium seats ($42 each) for the game, and were almost right behind home plate in the seats that had seat cushions and cup holders.  My BF was very pleased with the beer selections (Full Sail and Deschutes, not just the typical Miller and Bud offerings).  They finally brought in Dodger dogs this year - boiled with short buns, nothing special.  I still prefer them grilled.

Stadium staff was all very friendly, esp the beer guy in our section who said my BF looked like some movie star.  On behalf of the concession staff... FRANK, GIVE THEM SOME SHADE!  The beer/food stands outside of the actual buildings only had slatted roofs, so no sun protection at all, and no misters.  The poor people were totally roasting, and that was annoying to see.

"I rarely disagree with the average yelp ratings... I tried Blue Adobe based on great reviews but was greatly disappointed.

I really can't find a redeeming quality about the night... I had their ""killer margarita"" which is a cheaper house margarita, it was lousy, i was a bartender for some time myself, there is no reason to make a margarita that bad, you can do better, especially here in AZ we are a mecca of citrus!

The bean and cheese dip appetizer was uninspired, nothing special... I saw lobster tamales on the menu and couldn't get past them, i could not think of a way that someone could make a tamale with lobster and make it well, so i was really excited to see how they do it... poorly was how they did it, lobster was over cooked there was very little of it in the tamale and the biggest issue was exactly what i thought it would be, the corn masa just overpowered the little lobster that was in the tamale... they could have put imitation crab in there and saved them self a bunch of money and it would taste the same... it just doesn't work! There was a raspberry chipotle sauce on the side that was very good, but again this too took away from the whole point of the dish: the lobster.  

tried a chimmichunga, whatever, not special.  

service was no good, our waitress was very frantic, I felt like i was a burden or a bother to her (and no, I'm not. I've spent years in food service, makes you very kind to your server)

As I frequent The Moon often, I was happy to see the bar was busy as well. The bartender quickly came over and was noticably intoxicated, as she could not even tell me the flavors of vodka they had. We ordered our drinks, and watched as she broke glass into the ice, knocked over glassware and broke a beer bottle. As we looked around most of the guests had the same look of horror on their face. We decided to order some food, as she spilled my drink on us (refilled it with something completely different) and she could barely even talk at this point.

"My friends kidnapped me for my birthday (yes, because they are wonderful), threw me in the back of my friend Jill's van and rushed me off (blindfolded of course) to Radio Milano.

My friend Lindsay knew I had been dying to go there (I love Postino--same owner and across the street--so I just knew Radio Milano was going to be amazing).

I've never met the man that owns these restaurants: La Grande Orange, Postino, Radio Milano etc (Lindsay apparently once did, lucky girl) but whoever he is, he is a business genius. 

The atmosphere of Radio Milano was sophisticated and classy without being uptight.  Everyone was extraordinarily nice and helpful.  True to form for this restaurateur's style, there is a large vase of (fresh every day) flowers that compliment the warm glow of the restaurant in general.

Our server welcomed us with what were presented as ""Italian Potato Chips"" and a delicious dipping sauce.  

The homemade ginger ale is so strong in taste, really good.

"Not a great experience last night at Eastwind. I'm going to start this by saying that I've been eating here for over 20 years, when it was Tokyo Express and now Eastwind. I was a customer weekly when I lived closer, now it's every 60 days or so.

We went for dinner around 8:00 and it took way too long to get seated in the half empty restaurant. We were seated next to a family that must have been friends or family with one server, as she was constantly at their table. She was there while we were waiting and obviously saw us before finally showing us to a table.  Our server was a guy that must have been new, as he seemed very nervous and didn't know the menu.  

So we ordered the sushi sampler for me and the Korean beef and a veggie roll for her. I got the sushi, but not the salad and soup that it comes with. The veggie roll turned into an egg roll. Everything came at once, and the server didn't make his return until we were done. After consulting with server #1, he took off the egg roll and our drink.

I like to ask for a knock my socks off never been here suggestion and he offered up the cheese steak, with peppers and mushroom. I went for it but was on the fence for my pasta side dish.. he handed me a sample of the tortalini and I was in heaven.

Service was polite, the place was busy but not crowded, it was clean, and very appealing to look around while waiting for our order.  Took about 10 minutes to arrive, not bad.

I thought the price was fair  and i could have went with just a half sandwich as it was very filling.

"Yoli's has recently been popping up on Yelp's 'Best Of' front page. Many people are mouthing out and as the food whore that I am, I needed to go out and try it for myself.

My previous research told me that there were many 5 stars and 3 stars reviews regarding the ambiance, service and food. It seemed that the place had be 5-stars for a while but trending analysis showed a decline in the late 2011- early 2012. Alright enough nerd talk-  it was a Saturday morning, I was starving and I needed a place to have brunch with my lady friend in town.

When it comes to brunch at Yoli's, you really need to leave all your expectations at the door. The neighborhood its in is a little sub-par, the parking situation isn't grand and the interior and patio decor resembles a home that stopped paying for landscaping services a long time ago. The tables outside are all basic basic plastic, they are not squeaky clean (or perfectly leveled) and the seating is pretty limited. If you are coming to Yoli's, you are coming here for the food and nothing else, this ain't no brunch at the Four Seasons.

Their menus are strictly breakfast/brunch related but at a 2-sided page list, their breakfast choices do have a large variety of flavors and prices. The food is on the stealthier side with skillet dishes, omelets and diner-style potato sides. My friend and I ordered their most popular dish, the El Monte- Hawaiian french toast sandwich filled with egg whites, turkey, bacon and cheese with a 'spicy orange marmalade'. At about $7, the sandwich was pretty large and filled me up easily after just half of it. The french toast itself was soft and spongy and the bacon had some crisp, but the turkey was very thinly-sliced deli meat so it didn't have a lot of flavor and the spicy marmalade was tasty but not spicy at all.

The service was a tad slow but the lady was very very courteous and nice to us, she just didn't stop by very often so we had to wait around for our drinks and our check for quite a while. Overall I wasn't blown away with Yoli's but I would recommend as a place with decent portions and good prices. As of now, a 3.75 stars on my book.

I am a big supporter of local restaurants and I love seeing a family-owned business thrive. With a little bit more decor, faster service and a cleaner environment this place can return to be the GEM that people used to talk about. Yoli, if you are reading this- I hope you take this advice, we all want to see you succeed so we hope you can get back on that horse and impress the hell out of us.

"The Roosevelt seeps a cool vibe that can only be attained by converting a historic house into a den of drunkeness. Ah, a banker's dream.

This is where my coworker, Dani, and I went after eating at Sens. She was going to a blind date and didn't want to show up alone, for fear that this guy would be a total psycho who would cut her hair and eat it in front of her. But this time, I already had two incredibly strong and delicious martinis from Sens and was very glad to have taken the light rail. I ordered the oatmeat stout and was quite pleased with it.

Can I just say how much I loved the decor? I totally want to move in here...or use it as inspiration for our next home.

So, the blind date guy wasn't a total scode and I let after half an hour. Dani, who was apprehensive about meeting this guy--who's a doctor, and I told her if she wasn't interested toss him my way (sorry, honey)--ended up having a good time with a nice guy.

"Well, we all  went to a going away party here at Casey Moore's Oyster House and the place was fairly nice lots of security around  but very limited parking (we parked a few blocks away and had to walk in) food was good but my onion soup was way to salty though and the dip sandwich was by far the worst item to order on the menu (just sliced meat and bread)  and I had order it.  My wife ordered the shrimp scampi and for some reason it came out with a heavy cream sauce, no complaints because it was good but it was not scampi.  Tuna was perfect I had a chance to taste it  and that cooked perfect and I did notice a co- worker leave the 1/2 of the fish and chips on there plate no a good sign.  Clam chowder was good as a few friends did say they enjoyed it.  Calamari was off the chain ""Perfect"".  The server was warm,  friendly and polite and had some great suggestions for dinner and was very patient and waited for us to have  few rounds before we ordered dinner.  The place is pretty big and it seems that if you would come and sit in a different place each time it would be like going to a different place.  Music was jamming something for everyone. Folks were friendly and the place was packed.   

Now, cleanliness it  seems like it could use a wipe down, moping an a power wash in a few spots but I guess after a few cold ones you don't see it anymore.  Will I go back?  Yes, I would, affordable food, good music and  folks all in a good mood I'm there.

"I used to frequent the Buffalo Wild Wings on Litchfield and Bell and never had a bad experience.  Whether it was fight night on a Saturday evening or a lazy Tuesday dinner, I never was worried about the overall experience at that location.

This location, on the other hand, could take some hints from there now defunct location to the west.  I have been to this location 4 times with each visit hoping the previous one was a fluke.  I always would get their flagship item as well, wings.  I like the spicy garlic which I find as the best balance between flavor and heat.  Each time the chicken was either overcooked, under sauced, or both.  Why can't they do their staple item right each and every time?  Major disappointment, times 4.

I won't elaborate on the other shortcomings of this location because they are too many.  The bullet points are that the service is very lackadaisical with anything.  You sit down waiting longer for the service to take your order than it takes to get it out to you.  On multiple occasions a buddy of mine who I went with each time felt compelled to recite Reservoir Dogs lines when it came to drink refills.  They were few and far between.  Finally, I don't sit at the bar because I like to speak with the company I am in, but that was virtually impossible.  This wasn't just on event nights either.  The volume of the speakers didn't vary anytime, not even in the middle of the week during lunch.

"I went to La Boca two night in a row, Sunday/Monday, when I had to be in Tempe.  The first night our party of six were enjoying our pizzas when I casually mentioned that we'd ordered one pizza without mushrooms and some had found their way unto it.  Within a a couple of minutes the manager was at our table with an apology and an offer to comp a couple of deserts.  Geez, it was just an errant mushroom!  In fact, the pizza here is very good and they clearly go the extra mile in trying to accommodate their customers.
I was please enough to return the next night with my wife and share a Margarita pizza (which is very good).  Wanting something sweet to finish off our meal, we opted for the chocolate mousse.  While it may not have been the ultimate dessert it was quite good and we enjoyed several bites before deciding we'd had enough to satisfy without adding unnecessarily to our growing waistlines.  Seeing we'd only eaten a bit, the waitress comped the dessert.  We explained we'd been happy with the mousse and were just full but she took it off the bill just the same.

They also do an excellent job and his nails are always done right.  I've taken him elsewhere ONCE and they trimmed his nails down so much, that it hurt him to jump.  I thought he had an arthritic condition, when I realized that he had his nails done, and sure enough, he bounced back a week later.

These girls know what they're doing, and a couple of them have been there for a few years, as I recognize at least one or 2 of them every time I go in. Even to shop.

"Atmosphere good.  Food...not so much.  I recently ate here for the first time and, unfortunately, I can't say anything good about the food.  I ordered a chicken shwarma sandwich and expected a hot middle eastern sandwich filled with flavorful chicken sauteed with onions and spices and accompanied with crisp fresh veggies.  What I got was FAR from what I expected.  The pita bread was your typical crappy faux Wendy's style doughy flat bread 'pita', not a regular pita pocket.  Inside was some flavorless, cold, unseasoned chicken (and when I say flavorless I mean indistinguisable from a mouthful of cardboard).  They didn't even bother to put basic salt and pepper on this sorry meat.  The remainder of the sandwich consisted of raw zuchinni (WTF?!), chopped tomatoes, 3 leaves of romaine lettuce, and some bits of red onion.  None of the veggies had been dressed or seasoned.  Oh, there was also some hummus/tahini 'sauce' mixed in there (presumably for flavor), but I have never tasted anything so flavorless.  I imagine that wall spackle has more flavor and pizazz than this 'sauce'.  Come on Paisley, does your cook even TASTE what comes out of the kitchen?  Add some flavor to your food.  You could start with salt, fresh lemon juice, garlic, pepper, and high quality olive oil.

"Cartel is a coffee world unto itself for downtown Tempe, which is void of many non-alcoholic places to hang out.  Situated in what seems to be a motel from the outside and a garage on the inside, Cartel can satiate your brass tax coffee fix and your espresso lust for reasonable prices.  

The coffee is great.  Period.  They roast the beans themselves, know way too much about coffee and are proud.  The espresso, in whatever form you get it in, is rich and nutty.  The toddy (cold brewed iced coffee) is strong to the point of me jittering out the door from a small one.  The teas are various and steeped in a cool manner and timed according to their type.  The vibe can come off a little pretentious sometimes with all their rules and such, but they are selling a great product and the rules help distinguish them from the crowd.

I like to hangout here for an hour every week or so, good people watching, the pretentious guy behind the counter is good to listen to if you want to hear people getting so-so advice that they didn't ask for and my professors come here so it is a good place to catch them not in work mode.

My only complaint is that they need to find a way to get a bike rack closer to the door.

Was briefed by the server...p/u your sides...pick your meat...tell them how much weight of meat you want...also get unlimited slices of bread (white/wheat).  Boom you got your meal.  So I figured...instead of getting the sandwich...I can just make my own with the bread they gave me.   Liked how they weighed all the meat before you.  1/2lb of brisket didn't seem like a lot in my basket...but seemed liked what everybody was getting in around me.

"First let me say, that as a straight guy, I'm always a little apprehensive about going to gay bars for karaoke.  I know! I know! But my wife and I enjoy singing and have found it difficult to find places with decent sound systems that also have a decent catalogue of music, so I deal with it.  I've been to Kobalt twice now, the first time with my wife, and last night with a group of friends.  We had a lot of fun both times.  The music selection is one of the best we've found, although the sound system can be a little ""off"".  Sometimes the feedback can get a little strong on the wireless microphones.  I guess we're just spoiled by our regular karaoke haunt, and our hostess who mixes the music so you sound really good.  Here, it's just you and music baby!

I have to say, the crowd at Kobalt is really different (in a good way) than some of the other bars in town.  The patrons are very friendly, and very respectful (well, everyone except for the guy that told our friend she was built like a ""Brick Sh!thouse!""  I'm pretty sure he was just trying to tell her in his own way that she looked very lovely, which she did).  But seriously, that was a one-off and you get those in every crowd.   The bartender is really nice, very attentive, and remembered what we ordered from last week.  Huge props and huge tips!  The Karaoke host is great.  Works in new singers in a timely fashion and makes sure everyone has a good time.  

There's been a lot of talk about the smell of popcorn in previous reviews.  It's true; they have a popcorn machine by the patio door.  I've never tried it, but there's only been crumbs left when we got there both times so I guess it goes good with beer, apple martini's or whatever your choice of drink may be. I didn't find the smell overwhelming though, as some have said.

As for the catalogue, they have plenty to choose from.  You'll find a nice selection of country, rock, and of course...Showtunes!  You're almost guaranteed to hear Rent, Phantom, All that Jazz and plenty of old standards by Sinatra and the rest of the Pack.  FTW!

It was a little difficult to find at first, but if you drive around to the North side of the building, you can park under the structure and you'll see the sign in the breezeway.

"After having the FireTV for about a month now, I can confidently recommend this product for most people. Versus the current generation Apple TV, ChromeCast and Roku offerings, the FireTV is the best value due to it's access to a wide variety of content, build quality and advanced features. It's a device I have recommended to my (almost-elderly) parents my (geeky) friends.Best things about the FireTV: - It is fast - unlike the Roku it does not lag and feels like a high quality product - Has Amazon Prime Video access- if you have prime membership, this is the best accessory you can buy. Lots of great content from Comedy Central and newer movies versus Netflix. - An AppStore with apps games you actually want - Plex Showtime AnyTime are the big difference makers IMO. - If you have local video files on your network, Plex is the way to go. - Voice searchWorst things about the FireTV (which really aren't that bad): - Annoying/long intro video upon the first time you boot up - Larger power adapter versus Apple TV (Yes the little things count) - No HBOGO until late 2014 - Going to be a problem from the folks looking for their Game of Thrones fix this spring** - No chromecast/airplay like feature unless you have an amazon tablet**If you don't need HBOGO right now and don't have a bunch of apple products, stop reading this right now and buy this device. You won't regret it.** See below for ways around thisIf you are an advanced user and/or are on the fence this next section is for you.Before the FireTV, I had 3 Apple Tv 2's in my house that I used to access HBOGO, Hulu+, Netflix my local media through the infuse application. I had tried Roku's, ChromeCast and other media boxes/home theater pc's and the Apple TV worked best for me. While this has served me well there are obvious drawbacks - lack of 1080p video, limited app selection, no games, etc.... Which led me to trying the FireTV.Because the FireTV is based on android, android apps can be side loaded on the device and many work fine. The steps below will outline how to get started side loading apps to your FireTV. You may want to have a usb keyboard and mouse handy - you'll need them to get a few things running. Any old usb keyboard/mouse you have lying around should work OK.(The following links provide the best directions I have come across during my time with the device and have worked for me and should work for you too, but no promises)How to sideload applications to the FireTV:1. The first step in loading android apps is getting ADB set up on your machine can be done by following amazon's directions - developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/connecting-adb2. After that, you can go ahead and proceed with side loading applications, also by following amazon's directions - developer.amazon.com/sdk/asb/app-install.html3. If you aren't comfortable with working with the command line, and are running windows, you can try this great GUI application to automatically side load applications. - forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.phpt2736740Once you are able to send android apps (.apk) files to the FireTV, I recommend:1. Installing MXPlayer to allow .MKV .AVI video file playback: sites.google.com/site/mxvpen/download2. If your network drive/computer doesn't support plex, try using ESFileExplorer to navigate to play back video files - appsapk.com/es-file-explorer/3. AirReceiver which mimics the functionality of airplay on an appletv. Please note this only supports unencrypted video feeds. This is a paid app, buy play.google.com/store/apps/detailsidcom.softmedia.receiver4. HBOGO android app can be installed and works rather well. It does require a mouse to navigate.5. XBMC - If you know what this, you will want it and yes it works. Download via xbmc.orgFor the cord cutters out there, I've tried installing Aereo Slingbox with mixed results.

"Drive through or dine in. The drive-thru wait for your order can seem overlong. I'm a fan of their carne asada burritos and their chicken burritos - very tasty. Also their breakfast burritos. They use real tortillas, not gummy doughy ones like fast food joints use. All the burritos are huge - really two meals worth of food. But, they're not careful about removing gristle from the meat or excess liquid from the spoon before wrapping up your burrito. So if you're a picky eater or you don't like messy food, don't get any kind of burrito. Burgers and Philly cheese steak sandwiches are also pretty good. They have a big variety on the menu actually.

"Marcellino and Sima are finally back after their yearly 1 month Italy vacation (re-opened September 10th)....and are we glad they are back!  

We had a fabulous duo appetizer: fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet (carpaccio) with shaved mushroom and black truffle!  Delicious!  I've always been a fan of prosciutto and melon, but the fresh fig was tremendous!

Marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread, mmmm, amazing.  I don't think you can get this anywhere (fresh), even here if you ask for it, but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time!

Pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle.  Best hand made pastas anywhere.  Perfect!

Main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables...and more truffles!  So right...so full!  I'm so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey!

"So normally I'm not that tough on places, but I think when you're serving Mexican food in Phoenix, there is a certain level of expectation.

They get one star for having decent service and another star for having quite good portions.  

On the other hand, the food was crap, especially for the price I was paying.  I had steak fajitas, not normally the cheapest thing, but for something between $12-$15 I expected something tastier.  If they had been the most delicious thing ever, I wouldn't have cared but I didn't even take the half of the food I had left home.  The steak had a funny after taste and a lot of my onions were burnt.  The beans were mediocre and tortillas were average.  

On the whole, it was a decent dining experience but not what I would have wanted for the price.  You can get a lot better Mexican food in Phoenix (and for a lot cheaper).  I'd recommend coming here only if it's the most convenient place.",normal tough place think serv mexican food phoenix certain level expect get star decent servic anoth star quit good portion hand food crap especi price pay steak fajita normal cheapest someth expect someth tastier delici ever care even take half food left home steak funni tast lot onion burnt bean mediocr tortilla averag whole decent dine experi would want price get lot better mexican food phoenix lot cheaper recommend come conveni place,0

"I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant where I have treated so poorly by the wait staff. I'm actually rethinking my Green rating because I sincerely think this is my worst restaurant experience.

The one good thing I can write is that this place is really cute and it has an inviting patio. Lots of string lights and cute bistro tables. I really thought I was in for a great evening. Oh how wrong I was.

My friend and I walked in and the hostess immediately sat us at a four top right in front of the door. Unless the restaurant is packed and the drafty table in front of the door is the last spot available, I do not want to sit in a place where incoming guests will constantly bump into my chair. I pointed to a seat in the back and after trying to convince me I didn't want *that* table, the hostess led us to the back. It's not the worst thing that could ever happen and that instance did not ruin my evening, it was just weird.

We sat and were greeted by our waitress, who initially seemed very nice. We both ordered water to start and I asked her for a drink menu. Apparently the drink menu is on the back of the regular menu. It's just so small that I missed it the first time. She told me that Friday night is the $4 frozen house margarita night, so I went with her suggestion. By the time I finish pulling out my ID, my dining partner was ready to order. We got a queso appetizer, the vegetarian tacos with a side salad, and the machaca plate.

While we waited, a few more groups came in, were greeted, and received their adult beverages. It had been ten minutes since I ordered my drink, so I tried to look for our waitress. 

She finally popped up five minutes later, but avoided all eye contact with our table. When she did see me, she quickly ran outside. I understand she might have had a few tables outside, but why have an inside section to wait as well? The table right next to us had an amazing server who brought them two orders of drinks in the time it took to get my water glass refilled. (Margarita was still MIA at this point.)

Then, the queso came out, brought by two hipsters. It looked like an over-microwaved styrofoam plate in a skillet and tasted just as bad. My friend tried to make the best out of the situation, but I was ready to call the manager. I really, really regret that I did not. 

Nasty queso juice dripped all over the table and there was no silverware or napkins to be found. AND no wait persons or a hostess to ask for said items. (Twenty minutes after I ordered my margarita, it was still MIA.)

Our waitress finally popped up and asked how the appetizer was. My friend cut me off and said it was different, but okay. He took rare this opportunity to ask for silverware. The waitress made an excuse that it should have been on the table already and went to grab some.  When she came back, I asked about my drink.

With another lame excuse that could have been avoided if she ever check on us in the then-thirty minute absence, she finally brought me my drink. It was OKAY, not worth $4... more like $2-3. 

Two seconds later, the food came out. At least we had silverware?

1) My veggie tacos and side salad were okay. Is it bad that the BEST part of meal was the white, iceberg lettuce salad?
2) My friend's machaca was bone dry. Isn't machaca supposed to be tender, rehydrated, and edible? 

All in all, the salsa was the best part of the meal. Yet, one cannot enjoy a dining experience on salsa alone. This was sincerely my worst experience at a restaurant and I will not go back to Mucho Gusto.",think ever restaur treat poorli wait staff actual rethink green rate sincer think worst restaur experi good write place realli cute invit patio lot string light cute bistro tabl realli thought great even oh wrong friend walk hostess immedi sat us four top right front door unless restaur pack drafti tabl front door last spot avail want sit place incom guest constantli bump chair point seat back tri convinc want tabl hostess led us back worst could ever happen instanc ruin even weird sat greet waitress initi seem nice order water start ask drink menu appar drink menu back regular menu small miss first told friday night frozen hous margarita night went suggest finish pull id dine partner readi order got queso appet vegetarian taco side salad machaca plate wait group came greet receiv adult beverag ten minut sinc order drink tri look waitress final pop five minut later avoid eye contact tabl see quickli ran outsid understand might tabl outsid insid section wait well tabl right next us amaz server brought two order drink took get water glass refil margarita still mia point queso came brought two hipster look like microwav styrofoam plate skillet tast friend tri make best situat readi call manag realli realli regret nasti queso juic drip tabl silverwar napkin found wait person hostess ask said twenti minut order margarita still mia waitress final pop ask appet friend cut said differ okay took rare opportun ask silverwar waitress made excus tabl alreadi went grab came back ask drink anoth lame excus could avoid ever check us thirti minut absenc final brought drink okay worth like two second later food came least silverwar veggi taco side salad okay best part meal white iceberg lettuc salad friend machaca bone dri machaca suppos tender rehydr edibl salsa best part meal yet cannot enjoy dine experi salsa alon sincer worst experi restaur go back mucho gusto,0

Yesterday I opened the cover ready to read and discovered the screen had apparently cracked, seemingly for no apparent reason (no extreme temperatures, dropping, pressure, etc.). A quick Google search revealed this is a common problem, especially for my model, which made me think Amazon would replace the device for me due to the obvious design flaw. Not a chance though. Despite endless reports of this problem popping up through simple internet searches the representative I spoke to denied this was a common problem and was only able to offer me a very slight discount on a new product.

"Ok, I usually write longer more intricate reviews about a restaurant but for this new establishment I will summerize.

1.  Great decor and ambience; would be better minus the flat screens
2.  Friendly service; but needs more training with food and knowledge of 
3.  Timing of Kitchen; if a table has two or more persons, food should come out at the same time or around the same time.  Especially when they are not sharing.
4.  Food; if you specialize in spring rolls, please make sure they are rolled up proficiently.  It needs to be tight, not loose:) Flavors are good, but there could be a variation of sauce for the spring rolls.  4 rotating flavors for over 20 rolls is not a good ratio.
5.  Pricing is not bad for some items, but I do agree with other reviews that for most items, the pricing is a little high for the neighborhood biz and the quality of food offered.

Overall, nice place to hang with friends for a drink and nibble before the actual dinner somewhere else.
I will give it a few more months for an update.  This place has potential, but not well executed. When opening a restaurant, you should be ready and able to.  If you are not, you should wait til the staff is well trained.   I believe the owner or chef is inexperience.  Hopefully, it will improve...

I cannot even identify what type of breading they used.  it actually ruined the sauce - i would have rather ate the sauce alone with a spoon.  We didn't even save the leftovers.  I won't not order from her again but will make note of these two items.

"I went today with three friends for dinner around 6 PM Sunday night. Though it seemed quite busy, I was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival. Outside seating, despite a hot Arizona summer, was pretty nice with shade. However, this is where the pleasanties end.

Our table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes. No one bothered to offer us drinks, and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers. When our waiter came, he did not even apologize for the wait, and we gave our orders: drinks, appetizers, and pita sandwiches.

The hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly, only twenty minutes later. Both were alright, but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips, and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita. We asked our waiter for extra pita, and he kindly agreed. The entire duration of dinner, it never came.

Refills were also a pain, as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter, and he wouldn't come until ten minutes later.

An hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches. I've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour. Half the tables outside already left, including tables that arrived after us, and we were the last ones served. The food was of average quality, and I've been to better with cheaper prices.

Slightly expensive, I can see as justified. But many agree that time is worth much more than money. I had an excessive amount, over an hour and a half, wasted on a decellerating Sunday night. Staff is kind of nice, but I suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself aren't immediately turned off.

"Fuego Bistro is one of my new favorites! A couple people have recommended it to me, so my boyfriend and I decided to try it for restaurant week. 

We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation to have a drink on the patio. The staff was super welcoming and friendly. Matt enjoyed a mai tai and I had a red sangria - both very refreshing. Our table was ready right on time and we had an awesome waitress who gave great suggestions on ordering... there were so many good looking options on their restaurant week menu. We're sharers, so we ordered with that in mind. 

Drinks: 
We got the pomegranate mojito (very refreshing) and a peach-blood orange mojito (sweet, but very good)

Starters: 
Signature empanadas: Tasty. The focus was the meat, I would have preferred more vegetables inside.
Sauteed prawns: The star here were the sauces - delicious!

Entrees: 
Cola Braised Short Ribs: AMAZING! Some of the best we've ever had. The short ribs were very tender and not fatty at all. The flavor was so good!
Pernil Asado (shredded pork): So delicious!! I made little tacos with their fresh corn tortillas. 

Sides: 
Green chili cornbread casserole: A little drier than I had imagined, but great flavor. 
Maple chiliglazed carrots: The glaze didn't really stand out to me, but good as far as baby carrots go.
Jalapeno creamed corn: I was pleasantly surprised - really enjoyed this one! 
Chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes: A great side with the short rib. 

Dessert: (By this point, we knew we'd need to be rolled out of the restaurant, but we HAD to have dessert since it was part of restaurant week). 
Chocolate chip bread pudding: Really good chocolate chip bread with scoops of malted chocolate crisp ice cream. This was a lot of food after that meal, but I savored the bites I had. The ice cream was excellent!
Banana burrito: exactly what you'd picture with scoops of the same icecream - delicious!

We were underwhelmed by the food and hated the environment. Two of us built our own burgers, and one ordered a pre-made pick off the menu. We had the dill chips (fried pickles) as an appetizer. I can't say that any of us loved our meal, and as soon as we walked out we all agreed we weren't interested in going back. It was just no better than you could make at home (and I burn soup).  
The tables were crowded, too close together, and the place was uncomfortably noisy. Our servers were trying to clear plates as soon as one of us set down a fork (no one was waiting for our table), and asked for our dessert orders while we were still eating.

Upon walking in, everything from the atmosphere, decor and staff was warm and inviting. We each ordered a 3 course meal, and agreed on different selections.

We tasted from every section of their menu, including raw (butterfish and albacore), cooked (gnocchi and risotto), and meat (short rib and pork belly). Pretty much everything was ""my favorite,"" and a couple of glasses of Barbara complemented the meal perfectly.

"I just cannot understand why this place is so highly rated. Could it be that people have never experienced barbeque outside of Arizona, so they have no basis of comparison? But even that cannot be true. We have Joe's in Gilbert, and even Famous Dave's is pretty darn good. 

I work a block from this location, so I have been there at least a dozen times. While not great, it is something different once in awhile, so I put in an appearance now and then. The food is not bad, per se, it is just not that good. The prices, on the other hand, are far too high for what you get. $11 gets you a ""large sandwich"" which is not very large, an order of fries, and a soda--RC brands. For a couple of bucks more I could get a combo platter at Famous Daves. 

Service is all business. I don't think I have ever seen a smile in the place. But it is fast. The place is usually dirty, but I am usually there right around lunch, so it might be better other times.

"Say hello to the Ghost Lounge, folks. This is a brand new bar located right next to Seamus, within the San Carlos through an agreement with the hotel's ownership. 

For years, I've thought the Hotel San Carlos was an under-appreciated (through its own fault) downtown venue. With the Ghost, the owner has finally executed a plan to revive its rightful place on the downtown Phoenix scene. This is apparent from the first step inside the lobby, which appears as it did in 1928 when the hotel first opened. If celebrities in the 1930s had to spend the night in Phoenix, back then a small, un-airconditioned cowboy town with around 50,000, they would have stayed here. (Or else the near-by Westward Ho). You get a taste of those times with the massive photographic blow-ups the Ghost has put up on its walls of various scenes from early 20th century downtown Phoenix. So large that you can zero in on individual pedestrians on the streets, and marvel at their bowties, cowboy hats, handkerchiefs and facial expressions. Back then, the San Carlos was probably one of the only places in town that was ""air-cooled."" (That may have meant it had swamp coolers. I haven't googled the history of air conditioning technology for this review.)

I'd describe the bar's style as grandiose, and classic old school Phoenix with an obligatory hint of Chicago (obligatory given the decades-old economic relationship betweeen the two cities that endures to this day). It has been beautifully done. I will be back often.",say hello ghost loung folk brand new bar locat right next seamu within san carlo agreement hotel ownership year thought hotel san carlo appreci fault downtown venu ghost owner final execut plan reviv right place downtown phoenix scene appar first step insid lobbi appear hotel first open celebr spend night phoenix back small un aircondit cowboy town around would stay els near westward ho get tast time massiv photograph blow up ghost put wall variou scene earli th centuri downtown phoenix larg zero individu pedestrian street marvel bowti cowboy hat handkerchief facial express back san carlo probabl place town air cool may meant swamp cooler googl histori air condit technolog review describ bar style grandios classic old school phoenix obligatori hint chicago obligatori given decad old econom relationship betweeen two citi endur day beauti done back often,0

"My wife and I were looking for a dinette table. We looked at many places and ended up at the RoomStore. We found a great table and decided to purchase the item. 

The salesman was nice and didn't provide too much pressure. 

There is a LARGE selection of items-couches, tables, chairs, dressers etc.

My problem was that we bought the table and had a deferred pickup due to moving into a new home several weeks down the road. I placed a small down payment to reserve my item. After several weeks, I contacted the RoomStore to pick up my item since I just moved into my new home. My item was not in stock and was told to call back later in the week. I called 4 days later and was informed the item was now available. 

Today, I went to pay the balance of my purchase and take home the table. Small problem, the table and chairs are not at this location.  I was given the choice to pick up the item at the distribution center 30 minutes away or wait until until Tuesday. I wish that during my several contacts during this process that someone would have told me that I wouldn't be able to pick up my item here or wait several other days. I was not happy!

The parking attendants will give you a ticket to take inside and AMC has a person there to give you back the $10 but the fact that you have to pay it to begin with sucks.

"I travel a lot for business and usually stay in Hampton Inns.  This one less than impressed me.  First and foremost, it is a 'motel'.  The door to the rooms open to the outside, which is not typical of a Hampton Inn. I was concerned to stay in such a hotel at first since I am a woman traveling alone.  The area is ok, and the hotel area seems to be pretty safe and well lit. The lobby and pool area are very pretty, but again...the doors open to the outside so when I was positioned right near the pool, I could hear everything that went on.  The bed was standard Hampton Inn bed (comfy) but the room was small.  My biggest complaint, by far, is how bad the noise carries.  I'm still sitting in the room and I can hear the entire conversation going on next door...I can make out every single word.  Additionally, I can hear the person upstairs.  Their sound insulation is terrible.  There is a gap around my door (and remember, it opens to the outside) so can hear everything that goes on outside, too.

"My sister recently took her '98 VW New Beetle to First Class Auto in Scottsdale, AZ for an overheating issue.  I'm normally the one who does the maintenance on the vehicle but I was ~600 miles away.  She described the symptoms as follows: overheating light came on while she was stuck in construction traffic and went back off once she was moving again.  I immediately suggested that the radiator fans may not be coming on for some reason.  Since I wasn't around to look at it, she took it to First Class Auto.

She relayed the symptoms to the guys at First Class and also SPECIFICALLY requested they check  radiator fan functionality.

They told her the water pump was cracked and leaking, needed a new thermostat and also replace the timing belt and serpentine belt while they were in there (water pump is driven by the timing belt on this engine--2.0L 8V 4 cyl AEG code).  Well, a) I personally replaced the timing belt, water pump and serpentine belt about 10,000 miles ago as preventative maintenance.  What's more is the car hasn't lost any coolant since the job.  So the water pump being cracked is highly unlikely!  I did not replace the thermostat, though.  Once she called me to tell me this, I told her to decline the work and either take it somewhere else or wait for me to make a trip out.

I had a job to do that brought me almost half way to the Phoenix area so I decided I would make the trip the rest of the way to have a look for myself yesterday.  FIRST thing I did was check the radiator fans.  I turned on the AC and the fans didn't come on at all.  I pop the cover off the strip fuse panel that resides on top of the battery and found a melted 30 AMP fuse.  Guess what that fuse is for?  The RADIATOR FANS!  Imagine that.  Being a car that lived most of its life in Michigan, some of the fuses and the fuse panel itself had become corroded and caused the one fuse and part of the fuse panel to melt.  The coolant level was exactly at the max level, right where it was after I did the maintenance on it 10,000 miles ago, not to mention I checked it before her recent trip to Scottsdale (didn't have to add anything.  The car doesn't leak a drop of coolant).

Local dealer had a new fuse panel in stock, I swapped it out and replaced all 3 of the 30 amp blade fuses as they were all corroded pretty badly.  The larger strip fuses were still decent.  The radiator fans now work as normal and the car does not overheat.  The hose coming off the thermostat also becomes pressurized and hot at the correct temperature as well, so that's definitely not a problem!  Fans also come on automatically once the coolant temp hits 99 deg Celsius like they're supposed to.  Problem solved!

I drove down to First Class Auto today to give them a chance to explain/defend themselves, but there was only one guy working in the shop who she didn't recognize and no one at the counter.  What great customer service!

So she COULD have spent the quoted $800 and STILL had the same problem!  She just got dinged for a ~$40 diagnostic fee... for an incorrect diagnosis.",sister recent took vw new beetl first class auto scottsdal az overh issu normal mainten vehicl mile away describ symptom follow overh light came stuck construct traffic went back move immedi suggest radiat fan may come reason sinc around look took first class auto relay symptom guy first class also specif request check radiat fan function told water pump crack leak need new thermostat also replac time belt serpentin belt water pump driven time belt engin l v cyl aeg code well person replac time belt water pump serpentin belt mile ago prevent mainten car lost coolant sinc job water pump crack highli unlik replac thermostat though call tell told declin work either take somewher els wait make trip job brought almost half way phoenix area decid would make trip rest way look yesterday first check radiat fan turn ac fan come pop cover strip fuse panel resid top batteri found melt amp fuse guess fuse radiat fan imagin car live life michigan fuse fuse panel becom corrod caus fuse part fuse panel melt coolant level exactli max level right mainten mile ago mention check recent trip scottsdal add anyth car leak drop coolant local dealer new fuse panel stock swap replac amp blade fuse corrod pretti badli larger strip fuse still decent radiat fan work normal car overheat hose come thermostat also becom pressur hot correct temperatur well definit problem fan also come automat coolant temp hit deg celsiu like suppos problem solv drove first class auto today give chanc explain defend guy work shop recogn counter great custom servic could spent quot still problem got ding diagnost fee incorrect diagnosi,0

"I don't know why I waited so long to visit Yogurtology; it's located conveniently next to my Safeway.  Why did i wait so long?!

Yogurtology has perfected self-serve froyo.  The flavors are spot-on...lemon meringue, birthday cake, NSA coffee, peach mango tart, cheesecake, mango, rootbeer...the list goes on...I always end up getting oatmeal cookie.  It's made in-house with real oatmeal cookies.  We're talking oatmeal cookie literally IN the froyo, none of that artificial flavor crap.  It is incredible.  

Instead of having little placards for the flavors, there are digital Sony TV screens that describe each flavor and a brief nutritional run-down.  Very high-tech!

The selection of toppings is unparalleled--baklava, three different kinds of twix and milky way, brownie, chocolate chip cookie bar, chocolate covered waffle cone, premium fruit and nuts...anything you can imagine, Yogurtology has it.  

Not only that, but the shop is impeccably clean, and the staff are consistently cheerful.  This place blows Yogurtland and Yogurtopia AND all other Yogurtology locations out of the water!!!

"So i'm not here to buy spices or shop for sheesha, i'm here for food. Lots and lots of food. Luckily for me, Haji-Baba is known for tons of food at decent prices so I have a promising evening of stuffing my face without breaking my wallet. God, I sound like a really cheap buffet commercial.

But really, to be truthfully, super blunt, honest-to-go-honest truth, Haji-Baba's food is not the best in the world but it is 1) fresh, 2) good quality, 3) tasty and 4) cheap. I am sure you can find better Mediterranean food around town, but this place is really good on your wallet and fits my needs just right. And hey, 215 reviews can't be lying. THE PEOPLE LIKE IT. They like it a lot.

I ordered the gyro deluxe (gyro with raw onions and feta cheese), a side order of hummus, Babaganoush (eggplant dip), tried my friends lamb tongue and a pistachio  baklava. 

If you are feeling adventurous and want to try the lamb tongue, lemme tell you: don't. Really, don't. There is nothing tasty about lamb tongue. It tastes slightly like roast beef but the texture resembles congealed liver patee and the big chunks are really scary. The only positive about eating tongue? Infinite pun jokes about talking about it forever. Get it?

The gyro meat was pretty standard in the Gyro deluxe sandwich, the best thing about it was the creamy fresh salty feta cheese. Its the freshest i've ever had and they really DO slap it on that sandwich, like a boss. The babaganoush was also very very tasty with the pickle and the black olive- however- i would have liked bigger pieces of roasted eggplant than a hummus-like texture. The hummus was just A-OK, it needed more of a PUNCH of flavor. Last but not least, the baklava is my favorite dessert in all the land.. so obviously I enjoyed it. Heavy on the honey and not very crispy on the nuts, but pretty decent nonetheless.

In conclusion, only use the tongue in your mouth and not the one on the menu, get as much feta cheese as your body can process and buy a desert to-go. BAM, lunch is served.",buy spice shop sheesha food lot lot food luckili haji baba known ton food decent price promis even stuf face without break wallet god sound like realli cheap buffet commerci realli truth super blunt honest go honest truth haji baba food best world fresh good qualiti tasti cheap sure find better mediterranean food around town place realli good wallet fit need right hey review lie peopl like like lot order gyro delux gyro raw onion feta chees side order hummu babaganoush eggplant dip tri friend lamb tongu pistachio baklava feel adventur want tri lamb tongu lemm tell realli noth tasti lamb tongu tast slightli like roast beef textur resembl congeal liver pate big chunk realli scari posit eat tongu infinit pun joke talk forev get gyro meat pretti standard gyro delux sandwich best creami fresh salti feta chees freshest ever realli slap sandwich like boss babaganoush also tasti pickl black oliv howev would like bigger piec roast eggplant hummu like textur hummu ok need punch flavor last least baklava favorit dessert land obvious enjoy heavi honey crispi nut pretti decent nonetheless conclus tongu mouth menu get much feta chees bodi process buy desert go bam lunch serv,0

It's is a true one of a kind store, it's so entertaining to just walk around in. The decor is fun, the inventory is even more fun, and the photo booth is by far the most fun!

The walls are full of great novelty items, such as the Smoking Baby (that actually smokes!), Yodeling Pickle (that actually yodels!), and Fake Cigarettes that are surprisingly realistic!

"Yelpers prove to be right yet again with the average 3 stars on this one... 

I was craving sushi and had a hot date with my sister-in-law last night to do dinner and a movie... It just so happened that Eat Pray Love was playing at the Tempe Marketplace Harkins Theater, so we decided to meet at Kabuki before the movie.  

I walked in first and asked how long the wait was for two... I as told 10 or 15 minutes.  Not so bad... so I decided to wait.  I walked outside and met up with my Alexa and we came back in about ten minutes later... As we did so, two other women came in and I saw that they were seated right away.  I looked at Alexa, looked up at the hostess stand, was thinking (WTF), and then went and asked nicely where we were on the list.  

""There are two tables before you,"" I was told.  ""It will likely be another ten minutes or so."" 

At that, I responded, ""is there another option, perhaps sushi bar, that I don't know about?""

And alas, there sure was... (they neglected to give me that option when I originally checked-in).  We were seated at the sushi bar at that moment and went on to have a very underwhelming meal.  Here's why:

-While the large portion cucumber salads we ordered were extremely tasty, the cucumbers were cut lengthwise in such a way that it was difficult to eat.  I prefer cucumbers diced in smaller pieces so they are easier to eat!

-Service - our waiter wasn't the friendliest... I felt kind of rushed by him when we were there.  Additionally, since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar, all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables, which was very distracting while we were eating!  Perhaps they could've moved the sushi ready for pick-up to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future?

-The sushi itself was good; not amazing.  We had a Sunset roll, a Lotus roll, a Large roll, and an order of Ikura.  I didn't realize the Lotus roll was going to have a ton of mayo along with the baked Lobster that came on top of it... it was a bit on the creamy side for my liking.

-To top things off, when the bill came, they overcharged us... a simple mistake, but given our experience, it was just one more negative thing... and then when I pointed it out, I barely got an apology at all.

With so many other restaurants to choose from in the Tempe Marketplace, I am not sure I'll return to Kabuki.

"Found the doctor via his website and called for an appointment. The ladies that answer the phone are sweet so I felt I made a good choice. I was taken into the room and a sweet girl asked me questions and told me the doctor would be right in. He came in quickly and asked if I would mind if someone that was following him would be present. Fine. The other guy walked in along with a lady (medical assistant maybe). No one introduced either of them. Dr. Racette didn't ask me one question and didn't address any of my concerns. He seemed to even brush off the questions I asked or responded with brusqueness. It was very irritating as a patient to be asking questions about serious topics like skin cancer and feel blown off. He prescribed a cream for me and was walking out the door minutes after seeing me and said he would have someone come in with the script. He never talked to me about how the cream works or what it does. Awful awful. Too top it off, they were supposed to call me with test results. I had to call them and the gal that answered said, ""no one called you with the results yet?: NO!! Will not see this doctor again.

"I have had it with the meat department at Whole Foods Market on Scottsdale Rd & the Mayo Blvd. They really suck.

I gave them another chance (out of desperation really) and they blew it!  I am so disappointed.  I purchased some turkey breasts there (3 of them) at around $30.00 for a 4 lb breast. I came home, froze two and cooked one. It smelled, but my husband insisted that it was the smoked smell of being in the butcher case with all the other meats.

I trusted his opinion and cooked it. Upon slicing it up for dinner, I found that the free range turkey was very fatty. It was gross but no one got sick luckily.

Well, now I just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse. It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is. It is definitely bad.

And it gets even worse! As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts (Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one), I pulled out about 8 inches of thick, fatty, I don't even know what from it. Let's just say it definitely LOOKS like the dead animal it is too. What ever that stuff is, it is all gray and rotten.

They are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money. I have had it with them! 

I am not surprised. They have always been trouble. Frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food. His is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty ""I don't care"" attitude.

I spent over $100.00 there on Turkey (ground & whole) and he (Frank) still charged me for the breast bones - and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash!

The meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted. The manager there cannot be trusted and has failed every time. It is really gross; top dollar for top trash! My husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the ""questionable meat"" instead of throwing it out!  

I am still nauseous from the smell, sight and from touching all that gray, rotting gross stuff. BLEECH!!!

I checked the bag before I left the market, so it was only a minor inconvenience.  Third time I ordered bacon, which was listed as available on the web site, and then contacted and advised it was not and may not be available for a few weeks.  Since I paid upon ordering, I had to go through the hassle of waiting for a refund.

I've also noticed inconsistency in portion size which is a problem considering you pay by product, rather than pound.  Boneless chops should be roughly 6-oz each, yet I've received 4-oz chops at times, resulting in 50% less product for the same price.  Not a deal breaker for me, but something to consider.

"One of my earliest memories of Phoenix concerns waking up under the eucalyptus trees that used to cover most of what is now the business park and shopping center next to what I will call the ""new"" Duck. The old one was far larger and would have been about where the Starbucks is now. Of course, I'm talking about 1973 here, so I digress. . . .

Anyway, the current abbreviated Duck remains one of my favorite places to relax and hang out in Phoenix. Now I have a little one who enjoys running through the grass near the patio and socializing with the other youngsters that frequent the place. The bar features interesting wines by the bottle and glass. Most nights the by-the-glass happy hour special is something rather interesting, in contrast to the ""red"" or ""white' found in other joints. The interior of the small bar is dark like a cellar. In fact, you can find a variety of atmospheres in and out of the Duck.

And the sandwiches! Yes, try them all.

By the time we were seated our service finally came together and I have to say we LOVED the unique shots and had almost every one on the menu. As for the food. The Hamachi Popper was by far my favorite. The HUGE disappointment other than the horrible service in the first 2 hours, was the elimination of the PB & Jelly roll. It was the ENTIRE reason I chose this place and they no longer have it! WTF? Had I not had 10 shots I would have been furious. Management was gracious enough to take off a couple shots from our bill for the chaos we had endured. It was appreciated.

"With a few hours past and a few tasks accomplished the next stop of my day would be at Pane Bianco - the sandwich shop from the Valley's most celebrated Chef, Chris Bianco.  Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.

Arriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take ""any seat I wanted"" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.

Having debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive ""Grandma Slice"" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.

Moving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was ""wow - that is a lot of cheese"" while my second, after a bite, was ""wow - that is a lot of flavor.""  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.

Largely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.  Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.  With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant... and honestly, that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months.",hour past task accomplish next stop day would pane bianco sandwich shop valley celebr chef chri bianco made pilgrimag eponym pizzeria first trip phoenix pane radar sinc day move town given lunch hour offic locat north scottsdal knew weekend would best luck would new websit http www pizzeriabianco com seven day p schedul roll week prior arriv surprisingli larg space especi compar matt jobot earlier day compar pizzeria bianco well shortli alloc park free lot juxtapos light rail debat moment whether dine go best opt former made way restaur two coupl alreadi sat greet two server suggest could take seat want opt bench center room menu await sat brows menu well daili special list chalkboard almost sound appeal bit differ saturday special list websit small list beverag avail ask soon readi order need minut defer request glass water would never reach even half empti despit drink consist restaur soon fill capac debat special eventu undet reason come first place soon place order sandwich appet told would minut wait check small market take away section featur famou focaccia can tomato dri pasta apparel return seat would arriv shortli first manchego tomato sauc focaccia del giorno featur bianco delect wood fire focaccia spongi glori top sweet ripe tomato ampl layer brini manchego probabl expens grandma slice ever yet also probabl best least par difara brooklyn best genr move next origin target desir sandwich bianco hous made mozzarella tomato basil wood fire focaccia first thought wow lot chees second bite wow lot flavor perhap pure sandwich find result exquisit ingredi top qualiti bread realli noth special composit sandwich asid fact simpli work larg unmanipul masterpiec improv touch sea salt crack black pepper larg unawar enter pane serv dessert much delight realiz soon sit three option avail day flourless chocol cake saw emerg kitchen tabl next look quit nice simpli way pass organ vanilla bean rice pud candi pecan anoth simplist stunner creami arborio rice imbu rich vanilla custard flick whole vanilla bean pecan crunch delic smooth flavor without overli sweet almost thick enough stand spoon straight quit best rice pud ever top five contend without shadow doubt reason return pane bianco though fair return would take pretti spectacular daili special prevent order exact trio chri team two two matter make way italian restaur honestli like measur hour day oppos week month,0

"Having been a little overwhelmed by the choices between all the new Kindles and which one to get, I ordered this new basic 79 Kindle first to take for a spin. So far, I like what I see. I also own a Kindle 3 so that's the only device I can really compare it to at this time (I think a comparison between other tablets and this Kindle is meaningless, this device is all about content and delivery):1. Form-factor - Compared to the Kindle 3, this Kindle feels more compact, lighter and easier to hold. My hands wrap around this better than K3. Reading books for a few hours at a stretch will be easier on this device compared to the K3. It is the lightest such device I have used compared to all previous Kindles and other tablets.2. Screen - I personally like the fact that there are no keys on the device and that keys come up on the screen when you need them. Delivers a better overall reading experience. However, navigating through the on-screen keyboard with the 5-way controller can be taxing if you need to do a lot of searching, and you might miss the full physical keyboard. I hardly search on the Kindle itself, I search for books on my laptop so this is a non-issue.3. Price! - At 79, you can't go wrong. Compared to buying paperback or hardcover editions, you will recover the cost of this in a matter of a few months because most Kindle content is priced cheaper than print editions (and you get it instantly, and can access it wherever you are). Not to mention all the free Kindle downloads available in the catalog.4. Display - almost the same E-ink display at the K3. No glare no reflection. You can sit in bright sunlight and read it just like a book. Page turns seem a lot faster on this compared to the K3.Read more",littl overwhelm choic new kindl get order new basic kindl first take spin far like see also kindl realli compar think comparison tablet kindl meaningless content deliveri form factor compar kindl kindl feel compact lighter easier hold hand wrap around better k read book hour stretch easier compar k lightest use compar previou kindl tablet screen person like fact key key come screen need deliv better overal read experi howev navig screen keyboard way control tax need lot search might miss full physic keyboard hardli search kindl search book laptop non issu price go wrong compar buy paperback hardcov edit recov cost matter month kindl content price cheaper print edit get instantli access wherev mention free kindl download avail catalog display almost e ink display k glare reflect sit bright sunlight like book page turn seem lot faster compar k,0

I'm going to upload a picture I took of Bobby Q's brisket because seriously, if you look at it and don't want to immediately die from desire, then you just don't like barbecue. If I had anything bad at all to say about Bobby Q, it would be that sometimes their meats can be slightly overdone but this is not the norm. Their quality control, considering how much food they must serve to keep up with the demand, is astounding.  Their prices are too high, but of course, you're paying for the almost Disney-esque atmosphere.

"This is a very pretty and very chic looking restaurant, and I hoped that the food was as good as the decor.  My friend and I had the sangria and the mojito, and then we shared a bruschetta and the garlic pizza.

I found the sangria a little on the acidic side, but drinkable, and it was fortified with something, because it was a lot stronger than it tasted.  My friend's mojito was good.

I LOVED the bruschetta. Not only were the toppings well-planned and delicious, but the bread had a nice crunch and a slightly smoky fire-baked taste to it. Ditto for the pizza, in which the crust shared the stage with the toppings.  Don't expect cheese-red sauce-and-pepperoni type pizzas, as you might expect from the look of the place, the pizza is artisianal.

Nearly half the seating is out on the patio, and one unusual feature is that the seats were low and the tables as well.  This makes it a good place to relax with your friends (as you feel like you're sitting on patio furniture) but harder to eat your food.

We had good service the night we went (a weeknight, around 8:30).  Zero wait for our table, and prompt, polite service.

"I purchased the introductory groupon they offered a few weeks ago, and was hesitant at first because I haven't had the greatest experiences using groupons.  I was pleasantly surprised.

I did look at some of the bad yelp reviews before going in, which made me nervous! So for those of you that only look at bad reviews, I hope you see this one and have a little more hope.

I had a stylist named Annie, she had pink hair.  Super friendly, and really appeared to want to get my style right.  Since I had read bad reviews before coming in about stylists not listening to the customer when they asked for the curling iron to be used for better curl, I was concerned she would do the same.  But, I let her know I was looking for good curl, and with thin/straight hair, it can be tricky to achieve.  She attempted to curl with just the round brush and hair dryer first, and when she was ""impressed by her curling abilities with a round brush,"" she was ""equally impressed with my hair's inability to hold a curl."" So she broke out the curling iron!

We made great small talk, and I let her know I would be back in a month when I go out to celebrate my birthday.

The salon is a fun, well-decorated environment.  It was pretty loud with the hair dryers going, but not terrible.  The less than perfect rating was that I saw people with mimosas/champagne, and while I had been offered something to drink, I figured I could just choose water or coffee, as that is usually is what at hair salons, I wasn't informed of my choices by the front desk staff.  Now I know for next time to ask for some bubbly!

Another good tip is to plan for longer than 45 minutes if you are planning to do a style with curls.  While I got started on my appointment about 5-10 minutes late, I was there for 1 hour (and I dont have super long, thick hair that takes a great deal of time).

"I'd say I've been to the Clubhouse a few times a year over the past five years or so. Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. 

The sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say ""sacrificed or as important"" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). 

The venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, ""don't wear pants,"" honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly ""cooler"" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? 

The answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. 

Hate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively.

"THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!!  It really deserves NO STARS!!!

You can only like this place if you don't know anything about Vietnamese food. 

What I tried...

Bun Bo Hue:  Broth didn't even taste like Bun Bo Hue.  Spicy but has no flavor.  Where's the beef shank or hog's feet?  You can't have Bun Bo Hue without the shank or hog's feet.  They use the cheapest cuts of meat.  This item was on their Daily Special.  

Pho Chin Nam:  The broth was super sweet.  You know what that means....MSG galore!!!!  Not even a hint of Anise star in the broth.  How can you specialize in Pho if you can't even make the broth taste right?

Service stinks.  I hate it when the waiter holds the bowl in such a way that his thumb is on the inside of the bowl while serving it.  The dude never refill the water, ask how things were, etc.

Vegetable platter was not fresh.  Bean sprouts were starting to brown. 

If you can't cook something why even bother serving it to customers.  I don't know about other entrees they offer but I won't be coming back to find out.  

This has to be one of the worse Vietnamese restaurant in the valley.

"Being the only gay bar in Scottsdale aside from BS West, I've found myself at Forbidden a few times.  Forbidden is an ambitious concept--a gay club with two rooms and two deejays in a city not known for its gay nightlife. Sadly Forbidden does not deliver.  

The club is usually pretty busy on a Saturday night, but the crowd leaves a bit to be desired.  The patrons are mostly unattractive, kind of trashy in fact, and not very friendly.  

I believe deejay in the main room does not change on the weekends, where he spins top 40 dance/pop to a drunk college-aged crowd.  In the OZ room (the smaller room) they have different local deejays, who, from what I've seen, spin a variety of different types of music--sometimes it's circuity music, sometimes it's eighties music, it all depends on the deejay for that night.  The OZ room has been pretty empty the few times I've been there.  The sound system in both rooms leaves quite a bit to be desired from a place that calls itself a club.  

The drinks are reasonably priced for a bar in Scottsdale.   The décor is okay, but not very interesting.  Forbidden isn't terrible.  It is, however, just plain boring (bad music on a bad sound system, uninteresting décor, and an unimpressive and unfriendly crowd)!",gay bar scottsdal asid bs west found forbidden time forbidden ambiti concept gay club two room two deejay citi known gay nightlif sadli forbidden deliv club usual pretti busi saturday night crowd leav bit desir patron mostli unattract kind trashi fact friendli believ deejay main room chang weekend spin top danc pop drunk colleg age crowd oz room smaller room differ local deejay seen spin varieti differ type music sometim circuiti music sometim eighti music depend deejay night oz room pretti empti time sound system room leav quit bit desir place call club drink reason price bar scottsdal cor okay interest forbidden terribl howev plain bore music sound system uninterest cor unimpress unfriendli crowd,1

After looking for a place to have a glass of wine late, I ended up here, as 3 or 4 other places in Old Town were either closed (Napoleon's and Tapas Papas Fritas both closed at 11 PM??? Well, Napoleon's closed forever, so I heard, but won't believe...) or dead. Citizen had a multi-course private affair they were finishing up.

Another bartender came in later and was relating his favorite summer drinks in a bon vivant fashion. They do have a killer Moscow Mule which is served in a copper tankard to keep it cool. 

I've been coming in here, on average maybe once or twice a year since around 2007, and let me say at AZ88 the good things don't change. They still have a tantalizing food menu (they are a full boar upscale restaurant), and a drink menu that, together, rival anything else, really, in Lower Scottsdale (and in much of the Valley).

"We stayed at the Scottsdale Hilton in one of their villas for New Years Eve. It was the perfect size for all of us staying there and it was close to where we were going to be in Scottsdale.

The villa had it's own kitchen fully equipped with a fridge, stove, sink and even had cups and glasses. There was a little seating area by the kitchen as well.

The bedrooms were both a good size and the master bedroom had a huuuuuge bathroom. It also had his and her's sink and tons of space. I was sad that I didn't get to use the shower because it was a walk-in shower and was spacious.

There was also a larger sitting area with a tv and fireplace and it also had a pull out bed from the couch. I recommend getting a villa if you will be sharing the space with a few people as there is tons of room!

To get to the block party we were going to, we called taxis and the Hilton also sent over shuttles to get us to and from. They weren't charging but did ask for tips. They were really easy to communicate with since we had so many people and they did an awesome job!

My only complaint is that some of the outlets in the bathroom and the room didn't work. It wasn't too big of a deal since I found one that worked that was luckily by a mirror so I could do my hair, haha.

"With quaint accommodations, friendly staff and interesting selection of food choices, I was able to forgive, and forget, that the Centurion didn't yet have a liquor license. 

The Centurion is a cozy (and by cozy, I mean small) place. But it has personality and I can imagine myself hanging out on the patio after work - in cooler weather. 

For those vegetarians out there, Centurion offers a diverse selection choices. For our lunch, my companion and I split a Heirloom Tomato (with Brie) Panini and the Shitake Spinach Risotto.  Both were flavorful. And the prices are quite reasonable at $8/each. 

The menu offers a diverse selection which includes burgers, pizza, pasta, salads (all around $9) and some higher priced dinner entrees (ranging from $23-$42). 

I hope to return to try their dinner entrees, the blue cheese crusted filet mignon sounds wonderful!

"It was my Birthday and my wife, her mom, a dear friend and I headed to Fleming's Steakhouse in Chandler, AZ. We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes. That, we did, unfortunately. 

The restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff. The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away. No one offered to bring more. Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one, my steak (a large  rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate, just the steak. I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe, her fillet mignon was laying there, in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it, be that a glaze, a leaf, a slice of whatever! At the prices asked by this restaurant, it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!! We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish? In short, we left hungry and wondering why we spent over $200 for the entire meal.

"I just finished my G & S meal that I ordered to-go; actually, I just finished throwing it out. It was HORRIBLE. And by horrible, I mean shamefully bad. And by shamefully bad, I mean, heinous! I had a very disappointing experience here about a year ago but I thought I would give it another try. I should have proceeded with caution when I asked the long-term employees at the neighboring Blockbuster what was good and to the person, they all stammered and failed to reply. Seriously, zero out of four could give me one ""great"" dish! I've lived in both Mpls & Chicago and my Ex used to travel the Orient and we were always surprised at how POOR the quality of Asian food was in this area and WHY the people here, seemed to like it!? It's absolutely baffling!
I had the Orange Beef & Spring Rolls. The Orange Beef looked scarey right in the container. But when i ate it - UGH! The texture was all off and the sauce..... it had these big, clear, GELATINOUS, ..... ugh ugh ugh! I can't even talk about it. Like biting into a ball of corn-starchy orange extract! I'm still sick from those few bites! [Truly.] And while I ordered vegetable spring rolls, I got what tasted like low-quality hamburger meat! In fact I finally identified the flavor and texture as: SAUSAGE! It was like an Asian Spring Roll with chunks of Italian Sausage inside!! How's that for a combo? Ugh...... [stomach turning]
I'm sorry, I'm a Single Parent and I'm usually grateful to have someone cook for me. Grateful even when i am paying. But during ""tough times"" when i actually ""treat"" myself and then plunk down $20(!!) for unedible... yuck - it's totally, TOTALLY unacceptable!

"I've been back a few times since the last review but the most notable was to see DJ Z-Trip. He was awesome, no complaints there.

Bar Smith though? They failed on so many levels. 

I got there sometime between 10:30 and 11:00 and there was about a 20 minute wait out front. Not the end of the world or anything but after finally getting in, there was a sea of bodies and another very long wait. About 50 people were lined up by the stair case waiting to get upstairs. There was a bouncer not allowing anyone up there until people would slowly trickle out. Why they put Z-Trip on the patio, I don't know. It's the size of a shoe box and was clearly to capacity before 11 PM. FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL!! 

I was in various lines roughly 50 minutes and still hadn't made it upstairs. Forget about stepping out of line to get a drink because you'd lose your place. The short of it is I paid for pre sale tickets, managed to get there at a decent time, and still had to wait close to an hour just to get in the same room as the guy. It was a total let down. 

At that point I was so ready to just walk out and ask for my money back. They clearly oversold the event and didn't give much thought about their patrons who paid money to see this DJ. They were going to fit every last body into that place if it killed them...and everyone else in there. 

After finally getting upstairs there were so many bodies, no one could move at all. It was a total clusterfuck. I finally made it to the back bar and stood in line for 10 minutes just to find out their card reader broke earlier in the night. Fantastic. No signs saying it was a cash bar, that would have been a nice gesture. 

Also, the bathrooms were downstairs, so forget about having to pee AT ALL during the 2+ hours you're there. If you had to go, you better hold it, otherwise you'd be waiting in line for another 30 minutes just to get back up. 

By the time Z-Trip came on, the sound was bass heavy and mildly distorted. I inched my way to various parts of the patio but the sound didn't get any better, so my partner and I said fuck it and went downstairs for the rest of the night. Thankfully they were playing his set downstairs and upstairs. At least people could move more easily downstairs. Plus the sound was better. And the bathrooms were actually accessible. 

Even at the end of the night, there were people standing in line waiting to get upstairs. Bar Smith gets a huge ""F"" as far as I'm concerned. I won't be back to this place for any headlining DJ. They obviously don't know how to run an event.",back time sinc last review notabl see dj z trip awesom complaint bar smith though fail mani level got sometim minut wait front end world anyth final get sea bodi anoth long wait peopl line stair case wait get upstair bouncer allow anyon peopl would slowli trickl put z trip patio know size shoe box clearli capac pm fail fail fail fail fail variou line roughli minut still made upstair forget step line get drink lose place short paid pre sale ticket manag get decent still wait close hour get room guy total let point readi walk ask money back clearli oversold event give much thought patron paid money see dj go fit everi last bodi place kill everyon els final get upstair mani bodi could move total clusterfuck final made back bar stood line minut find card reader broke earlier night fantast sign say cash bar would nice gestur also bathroom downstair forget pee hour go better hold otherwis wait line anoth minut get back z trip came sound bass heavi mildli distort inch way variou part patio sound get better partner said fuck went downstair rest night thank play set downstair upstair least peopl could move easili downstair plu sound better bathroom actual access even end night peopl stand line wait get upstair bar smith get huge f far concern back place headlin dj obvious know run event,1

"I had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here. I had been to Johnny Rocket's before and gotten the vegan option so I knew I would be ok going here. I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want. 

We get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA. 

About 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)

I start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean, really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience. 

All I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat. Stress that to them. Because obviously they aren't trained to know what the difference is.",worst experi vegetarian life johnni rocket gotten vegan option knew would ok go meat eat sister pescatarian husband figur place would best three us get want get order burger streamlin st mistak order boca burger waitress take order husband also order boca minut later food come patti look right littl apprehens gone gut feel eat day ignor awhil sinc eaten boca patti year thought look right nd mistak start eat half way bill hit tabl crowd waitress must tri get us look bill notic husband burger say turkey substitut immedi start freak call waitress explain order boca say turkey tell us boca say turkey say sound right goe talk manag guess never saw manag come tabl apolog profus happen upset hell confus boca turkey mean realli know peopl might think know differ thought well truth slip even though hurt everi think never come johnni rocket ever experi say vegan vegetarian go johnni rocket make sure waitress waiter know boca burger meat stress obvious train know differ,1

The fries were good, but they were just fries, nothing too special. The sweet potato fritters, on the other hand, were super tasty. They had a sound consistency and were loaded with rich flavor.

"I discovered this hidden gem while shopping at TJ's and returned for Happy Hour between 4 and 6:30 from T-F.  The patio is in the afternoon shade and far enough off Scottsdale Road to avoid street noise. The seven Tapas (appetizers) attracted my interest and I ended up selecting 1) ebi prawn with grilled fennel, 2) tartine of bouillabaisse and 3) Medjul dates with merguez sausage, sugar cured bacon for the Happy Hour price of 3 for $10 vs the normal 3 for $15.  The single prawn was large and equal in quality to the fresh prawns I had just tasted in New Zealand plus the fennel added more flavor.  The tartine of bouillabaisse was mostly small shrimp but again very tasty and tempting to order a bowl the next time around.  The three Medjul dates with sausage/bacon  was an unusual combination to my culinary experience and superb in flavor.  The select wines were about half the normal price and a definite value at $5 per glass.  In talking with the waiter I noticed there is live jazz on Fridays between 5 and 8.  I will definitely have to return on a Friday to try the other tappas and listen to the Swedish singer who sings some songs in German... see tappas photo...

"Treachery! Seek it out:

Let me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single P.F. Chang's I've had the misfortune of being dragged to.

P.F. Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food, with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food. They bill themselves as a ""gourmet"" Asian experience, which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entrées right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart. Everything is bland, overcooked, and ridiculously priced. 

Once you've paid nearly $14 for their ""orange peel chicken"", you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice. This is your second mistake. Sadly, the bistro calls you on your bullshit. You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.

Everything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy, things that should be sauced are too dry, things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods, all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.

Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F. Changs, while sounding vaguely Asian, is a wholly American creation. It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale, actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit, named Philip Chiang. (They literally cut out the poor bastard's ""i"" so that it would ""fit on the signs better,"" or, as I like to believe, not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.) It's highly Americanized (and yes, I've had Chinese food in China, but I've also enjoyed great ""American Chinese"" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of ""wok charred beef"", listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.

The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death. From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:

'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming. ""Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant,"" Jim told me, pointing at the statues. ""It's not lucky. It's something you put at a burial site! But in America, they think it's a Chinese thing."" From a Chinese perspective, P.F. Changs is decorated with death.'

"The line was ridiculous.  The price is kind of steep for what it is.  The dog is kind of messy because of the way it's made.  But you know what?  I enjoyed it in a way I haven't enjoyed a hot dog in years!  Wow, that sounds kind of dirty.  This really is a unique take on one of the most common American foods.

I passed through the sea of trucks and people that is Food Truck Fridays on a mission to finally try the much yelped about Short Leash Dogs.  I can't say much too much that hasn't already been said.  While the 20 minute wait wasn't too thrilling, it all paid off in the end.  I just went with a traditional wiener, with tomatoes, onion, relish and spicy mustard.  While I was intrigued to try some of Short Leash Dog's specialties, most of the dogs on today's menu contained an item or two that I don't really like, and I wanted to compare Short Leash Dogs to what I am accustomed to the first time around.  Good sausage, good toppings and the flat bread is fantastic.

"I almost don't even want to write a review for this place. It's so near and dear to my heart and I basically live here that I just don't know how to NOT write a novel of a review for this place. So I'll attempt to bullet point my feelings on the joint:

A. Friday Happy Hour - need I say more? Pretty sure all the homies would agree that we've spent thousands of dollars here over the years. You're welcome Lodge. 
B. Cheese Curds - FRIED cheese balls and ranch. nuff said. 
C. Best server ever, my homeboy Michael (you guys need to give him a raise. I haven't seen him around much lately and I'm pretty sure that's why I've been at Kelly's more recently)
D. Black-outs
D+. I have a scar on my left knee where I ate shit playing cornhole. How do you eat shit playing cornhole? No clue. Probably because of the above point listed above. 
E. Lodge stimulus package - $6 for a can of PBR, a shot of nasty ass whisky, and a cigarette. BEST DEAL IN TOWN. Pretty sure the ex got nice and hammered a few times off this lil package - great deal ladies. Get your man sloshed and then take advantage of him. Always a good idea. 

The only reason why there's not 5 stars is sometimes when you sit on the patio, it takes about a year for a server to come around. Best bet it to hunt one of them down and start a tab that way.

I ordered a glass of the crossing, which was tangy, and a little on the dry side with a fruity aroma.  Going off of a college student's budget, we shared a plate of the bruschetta which was a bit pricey for 4 slices of baguette with toppings, but delicious nonetheless. Pulled pork and salmon were my two favorite!

"Jerry's...  Ugh!  I try to like you since we live so close to each other but...  Ugh!
I have had numerous irritating experiences at Jerry's.  In a nutshell...
I use red Prismacolor pencils.  I run out and go to Jerry's, they don't have them, don't know if they carry them and and nobody can tell me when and if they might reappear.  Why?  The (seemingly) canned answer is because the order comes from corporate, in North Carolina or somewhere far, far away where there is no phone or email access.  I go to buy Sculpey... OUT!  Same answer as to when it might return.  I need Faber Castell PITT brush tip markers...  OUT!  The same story with some airbrush materials. 
""Come back Tuesday or Thursday or just give us a call and we'll check if it's in...""   
I can walk to Jerry's in less than 10 mins but I would rather go to AZ Art or anywhere else than have to call everytime I need some stuff.  I can go to AZ Art in Tempe and when something is out can order from their mother store and it's there the next day.  

The clerks I have dealt with there are part of my rant.  Of the handful that I have dealt with, (mostly morning and daytime) it seems like they don't really know the store well or give a crap to give some insight on their products or company.
They do have a big store and I understand that there is alot of inventory to know about and be able to locate but that is your job.  It just seems like nobody that I have dealt with there is really keyed in on knowing their stuff.
I spoke to a gal there who was really chatting me up on her recent art night where she painted this huge piece and blah blah blah but when I asked if she knew when they might have more of the brush tip markers she was mum.   ""No clue.""

"My wife and I had reservations there last night.  Poor choice! Not a bad place to eat, but a terrible dining experience. 

Parking was an issue. Despite our early reservations, the only parking available was in the next lot over. One had to traverse an earthen embankment and a grubby alley to get to the place. Tell your companion to wear something other than high heels!

I dislike places that serve olive oil in place of butter with one's bread. I know it's fashionable, but it gives an impression of economy. That's fine for Macaroni's Italian Grill, but detracts from the tone of a place with Tarbell's pretensions. I'd prefer it if they'd serve both, or at least give one a choice. 

The soup of the day, potato and leek, was of delicate flavor but redolent of Potato Buds. Could it be possible that they're making this stuff out of a dehydrated product? The Caesar salad starter was a nonentity, and might have been improved by a little ground pepper, which wasn't offered. 

My bride was mightily impressed by the grilled salmon....some of the best she'd ever had, she said. The effect was somewhat dissipated by the peculiar potato product offered as a side. If you like to peel off and eat the crust around the edges of a pan just used to bake scalloped potatoes au gratin, you'll like this stuff. 

I had the pork chop, which was very good without being memorable. It's served with a side of what they claim to be 'wild boar bacon' and unidentified greens. The pork, independently, was bland and without much character; but spear a bit of pork, add to the end of your fork a fragment of bacon, and then a green or two, and the dish is much improved. 

Dessert was uninteresting. The sorbet was of the store bought variety....and not top shelf stuff, either....and the apple tart was bland and as dry as if it been left in the oven overlong. 

The ambiance of the place leaves a lot to be desired for a celebratory experience. It might work for a business meeting, but it ain't no place I'd care to take a date, ever again. The dining room is crowded and noisy, making conversation difficult and at times impossible. The tables are too close together and I had to endure a face full of server's butt whenever he waited on, or cleared the dishes of, the folks at the table neighboring ours. 

I suppose I've saved the best....or the worst....for last. I haven't been as rushed by the waitstaff at a meal since my experience in an Army mess hall at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina. The place is being run as a money making machine and that means that they are trying to turn over tables as many times as possible in an evening. Services is overly rapid and one feels pressured to finish up and allow the waitstaff to get the next course on the table. The object, of course, is to get you fed and out the door, freeing up a table for another party. My wife resorted to the tactic of picking up her fork when she saw the bus-guy approaching....otherwise he'd be on us to clear the plates containing food over which we were tarrying, in his opinion, overlong.

The check was presented to us the moment it was ascertained that we had completed dessert but before the plates had been cleared. I returned it asking that she bring it on AFTER we'd finished our coffee. Which, by the way, hadn't been offered, either. 

To his credit, the dining room manager did come over to apologize for rushing us, and comp'ed our coffee. He explained that ""the standard in America is to present the bill when dessert had been finished"". I beg your pardon? Not in any place I've ever dined, and I was born in Ohio.

This place seems popular enough on a Saturday night, but I certainly won't be gracing its dining room any time soon. At this price point ($175 including wine and tip for the two of us) I expect more than what was offered. 

Sorry, folks, I know this sounds like a rant, and to some extent it is. It was an important evening for us....after all, twenty years only comes once in a marriage (well, most marriages, anyway)... and we had hoped for a gentler experience.",wife reserv last night poor choic place eat terribl dine experi park issu despit earli reserv park avail next lot travers earthen embank grubbi alley get place tell companion wear someth high heel dislik place serv oliv oil place butter bread know fashion give impress economi fine macaroni italian grill detract tone place tarbel pretens prefer serv least give choic soup day potato leek delic flavor redol potato bud could possibl make stuff dehydr product caesar salad starter nonent might improv littl ground pepper offer bride mightili impress grill salmon best ever said effect somewhat dissip peculiar potato product offer side like peel eat crust around edg pan use bake scallop potato au gratin like stuff pork chop good without memor serv side claim wild boar bacon unidentifi green pork independ bland without much charact spear bit pork add end fork fragment bacon green two dish much improv dessert uninterest sorbet store bought varieti top shelf stuff either appl tart bland dri left oven overlong ambianc place leav lot desir celebratori experi might work busi meet place care take date ever dine room crowd noisi make convers difficult time imposs tabl close togeth endur face full server butt whenev wait clear dish folk tabl neighbor suppos save best worst last rush waitstaff meal sinc experi armi mess hall ft bragg north carolina place run money make machin mean tri turn tabl mani time possibl even servic overli rapid feel pressur finish allow waitstaff get next cours tabl object cours get fed door free tabl anoth parti wife resort tactic pick fork saw bu guy approach otherwis us clear plate contain food tarri opinion overlong check present us moment ascertain complet dessert plate clear return ask bring finish coffe way offer either credit dine room manag come apolog rush us comp ed coffe explain standard america present bill dessert finish beg pardon place ever dine born ohio place seem popular enough saturday night certainli grace dine room soon price point includ wine tip two us expect offer sorri folk know sound like rant extent import even us twenti year come marriag well marriag anyway hope gentler experi,0

Just put something on it to give it with that brulee feel or name it a vanilla shake. The best way to explain my feelings would be to say it was like setting up a date with someone on-line and having them show up and it's clear they are photogenic but possibly altered a bit and not the hottie in the pics on their profile.

"I have to admit: I am impressed.

I have been to a few vegan-only-menu restaurants and I was... underwhelmed. Nothing against the raw food movement, but unless it is a raw-specific place, I expect more creativity. Show me what food can do, be, taste like. Don't just cut it up and toss it on a plate.

Four of us came in to eat on a Saturday and the place was PACKED. A good sign, surely, AND it was a really great mix of demographics: young and old, many nationalities, singles, couples, families... we liked that it had a wide appeal.

The place smelled fantastic, too, so we started perusing the menu long before we had a table to sit at. We waited about ten minutes for a table. It's a bit like a cafeteria in that you order and pay at the counter, and the food is brought to your table.

While we waited we were given a bowl of the ""house soup"" which, basically, was warm carrot water with a piece of carrot or two and some tiny, tiny mushrooms. We all agreed that it needed more of a broth flavor (more types of veg? more mushrooms?), but it was tasty enough and definitely whet our appetites for more.

The spring rolls were really good but needed more. As we removed the peanuts for my friend, I ""blame"" this on us... I will have to have them with the peanuts next time.

The crispy rolls were spiced and savory and light and perfectly crispy. 

My favorite had to be the Pate Chaude. Flaky, savory with a bite from a wonderful combination of spices, and a meatiness from the mushrooms that made us think a die-hard carnivore in our lives may not miss the meat if he were to eat it. THE dish of the day, hands down.

The curries were a bit bland (Save-Planet and Divine Curry Noodles). They were fine, OK, but nothing that made us think we'd come just for that. Much better elsewhere.

The Gracious Spicy Noodle soup was really tasty but it needed a tad more spice. With spicy in the name, we expected more. 

Some stuff is pretty basic: the sushi rolls are basic veggie sushi rolls. The rainbow salad is a tasty but commonplace cabbage and carrot slaw. The fried rice was fried rice. All yummy, all fine to eat, but nothing spectacular, different, or altogether exciting. Basic isn't bad.

Four stars for the surprising and amazing pate chaude and the rolls, for sure. Ideally, 3.5 stars this trip, but I rounded up for the good parts. 

Couldn't go five stars for two reasons: too many items were just basic and the service is slooooooooow. 20+ minutes for fried rice (that we had to ask about)? 25+ minutes for some soup? It was a crap shoot as to what was going to be delivered and when. While they were swamped when we came in, the crowd was thinning out for their afternoon down time (they close from 3p-5p). Overall, our lunch took over 2 hours, most of it waiting on dishes to come out. No bueno if you have other plans that day.

So... tasty, some major standouts, some ""meh, I've had this before."" We *WILL* absolutely go back to give the menu more of a chance to wow us; the ones that knocked us off our feet are worth the return.

First, they didn't seem to have the proper ventilation for Korean BBQ.  I have never been to a place where you could see smoke throughout the restaurant from people cooking at their table.  Second, the service was AWFUL.

The food was decent but the seafood pancake was super disappointing.

"I wasn't feeling RnR at all!  We don't usually venture into Scottsdale for many reasons, but the siren song of a non-pretentious late night eatery was just calling to us.  Unfortunately, non-pretentious doesn't apply to the prices.  We came shortly after opening day, so I completely forgive the awful service, the place was packed.  I was irritated though when we were told they were only going to be serving sandwiches and burgers, nothing else, even though we were specifically told that this place would have breakfast all day.  Breakfast is what I wanted.  Oh well.  

We ordered the burger and got some mini corn dogs as an appetizer.  The mini corn dogs left a lot to be desired.  They were served with plain ol' ketchup and plain ol' yellow mustard.  Yuck.  The corn dogs were only okay.  The breading around them was way too bread like and it was just lacking in flavor.  The burger was enormous.  Unfortunately, what it lacked any flavor.  I guess what it lacked in flavor it was clearly making up for in size.  The bacon that came on it was equally huge, roughly 2 inches wide and at least 8 inches long... (that's what she said! Ohhhh!)  Anyway, I was obviously not impressed.  We might come back sometime, because their breakfast really does sound wonderful, but hopefully they've figured out how to efficiently serve a busy restaurant by then.",feel rnr usual ventur scottsdal mani reason siren song non pretenti late night eateri call us unfortun non pretenti appli price came shortli open day complet forgiv aw servic place pack irrit though told go serv sandwich burger noth els even though specif told place would breakfast day breakfast want oh well order burger got mini corn dog appet mini corn dog left lot desir serv plain ol ketchup plain ol yellow mustard yuck corn dog okay bread around way bread like lack flavor burger enorm unfortun lack flavor guess lack flavor clearli make size bacon came equal huge roughli inch wide least inch long said ohhhh anyway obvious impress might come back sometim breakfast realli sound wonder hope figur effici serv busi restaur,0

Funny huh, this place literally looks worse then some of the barrio shops in rocky point, it seems like it is the day after thanksgiving every day there, and people literally throw stuff anywhere.

For the guys this place is a pretty good place to go, the deals on shoes are unreal, nikes that are $100.00 bucks for like $20.00, you can't get that anywhere. 

You can also get top notch clothing and make you look like a true Scottsdale deuschbag for less then 100 bucks Rolex or Tag Heur watches will not be found here, sorry deuschbaggery only goes so far at last chance. 

In any event this is probably one of the best bargain basement places in the valley to get top notch stuff.

"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more",purchas year rare write review felt compel write although review point never seen good product get review hope peopl purchas star rate accur product address three biggest complaint other sound qualiti think headphon sound great never own expens pair abl compar higher end offer own dozen cheap mid rang headphon rang audiophil musician miss someth come fine ignor would say slightli better appl bud like much use year recent use redesign one year tinni listen sound common headphon price rang far peopl say compar appl bud well know mayb crazi exclus version appl bud amaz compar regular earpod think headphon actual sound bit better provid nice full sound repres high low mid equal well mainli listen metal fit feel peopl complain fall feel like go fall ear valid although obvious depend specif ear feel like go fall give cord tug stay secur appl bud,0

"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (bw, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops.

There is no indication next to the names of the yogurts what ingredients are in it, so I am docking a star for that. I'm trying to avoid eating eggs as much as I can and it is always helpful when that information is available without having to ask. I have been on the website enough times now to know which flavors have eggs and which don't so its not a problem for me anymore, but for anyone else it would be. But the flavors I have had have all been good. The fruity pebble flavor I had awhile ago actually tasted just like the cereal. It was a fun flavor. 

The topping bar is a good size. There are fruits, candies, and nuts among other toppings. My husband and I are generally happy with this topping bar. 

The best thing about this location is on Wednesdays, if you come in wearing pajamas (or something resembling pajamas) you get 50% off your total! Its a great deal.

"Rinaldi's Italian Deli is a very good place for lunch if your in this area and looking for something a little lighter than a burger and fries.  They are conveniently located near the corner on Deer Valley and 19th ave, next to Dunkin Donuts.  They are open for breakfast, lunch and an early dinner.  

I recommend going during breakfast or lunch if your interested in their ""Specials of the Day"" that are on their hot plates. These items don't look too appetizing if you go by in the late afternoon or evening. 

They offer homemade soups and fresh cut salads loaded with just about anything you could imagine.  They have a small selection of homemade pasta salads as well.  

I had their pastrami on rye with their spicey, nazzle opening, and horse radishy dressing.  The pastrami was very good but had to be heated in a micro-wave. My sandwich was assembled very well so props to the girl behind the counter!  Their Italian pasta salad was excellent. Their Cob salad was also very good, nothing fancy but a good balance of veggies, bacon, egg, tomato, blue cheese, avocado with grilled chicken.

"I think the high reviews of Sofrita must simply be a function of the limited dining options in Fountain Hills as this is the worst excuse for tapas that I've ever had.  We walked in and were greeted by a strange, musty smell that remained pervasive throughout the meal.  We should have taken that as an indication of what was to come and left, but based on the great reviews, decided to stay.  Big mistake.

I ordered a red sangria which was okay, but had a strange flavor of figs or dates so I'm not sure if it was just made with old wine that had turned and took on a prune juice flavor or if that taste was intentional.  We ordered the olives, fried potatoes, grilled zucchini, shisito peppers, and four different types of bruschetta.  The olives were, well, olives (tough to ruin those) but also contained some off-putting caperberries that we avoided.  The grilled zucchini was just plain zucchini with no seasoning whatsoever served with a side of what looked like potato salad as a dip, but we never really could identify what that substance was as it had absolutely no flavor so we opted to avoid the fat that it was obviously adding to the zucchini.  The shisito peppers had no spice or flavor at all and were absolutely swimming in oil.  I've never had a ""roasted"" pepper that was so soaked in grease.  The waitress asked if we didn't like the peppers when she noticed that all but a few remained and when we pointed out how greasy they were, politely took them off the bill.  The four pieces of bruschetta were all of different varieties: roasted eggplant; ripe tomatoes; avocado and beans; and grilled artichoke with cheese.  The bread was thick and chewy and none of the bruschettas had much flavor at all.  In fact, I think if I had just closed my eyes and randomly selected one off the plate, I probably wouldn't have been able to tell which it was.  The fried potato wedges were actually the best part of the meal, which is sad when the best item is a simple fried potato.

The atmosphere was severely lacking as there were candles on all of the tables and numerous votives on the walls, but not a single one was lit.  The restroom was extremely dark and was absolutely filled with unlit votive candles so I'm not sure if this was an attempt at saving costs, but had I known this, I would have gladly spared a box of votives from home just to create some sort of ambiance while we ate.  The place is also incredibly tiny so I have no idea where the flamenco band and dancers that other reviews have spoken of would perform.  If anyone tried to move through there, they would literally be bumping into tables.  

While I love tapas style dining, if this were the only tapas restaurant that there was, I would gladly forego the experience.

"I purchased the Enotria groupon when it was released last year and had a horrible experience at the restaurant.

1) I ordered a cheese platter. The platter was very much overpriced at over $18.00. The most problematic thing is that Enotria ordered the food from another restaurant on Mayo Blvd and had it delivered to them. The same is true with Pizza. If you order pizza there, it will be delivered from another restaurant in the Mayo shopping plaza. Enotria is taking a significant markup on the food because they are paying another vendor for it. AVOID THIS!!

2) Another disturbing aspect of the visit was that we were served disproportionately small portion because we were using a groupon. We ordered two glasses of red wine. The waiter (who also happened to be the owner) served us a glass that was 1/3 of what is typically served.

The only positive aspect of Enotria is that they have a good selection of wines. To be sincere, you are much better off going to a more reputable establishment in the area like White Chocolate Grill.

Oh, also keep in mind that the current owner bought the restaurant over a year ago. It has changed ownership several times and the overall quality is suffering because of this.

"Harkins 16 is exactly like every other Harkins theater.  That it to say, a huge, context-less concrete box in the middle of the desert that shows the same movies as their competitors.  I saw the Simpsons movie here tonight and just have a few thoughts to share.

-The Cine Capri screen is big.  Anyone who has visited either the Scottsdale location or now-defunct Camelback relic knows this, but I felt it was worth repeating.  Very cool to see a movie on a screen larger than life itself.

-There is always ""that guy"" in the theater.  You know, the one that laughs as loud as a bullhorn, repeats everything that happens on-screen, and occasionally yells out something profane or derogatory.  Now, imagine a theater where every guy is ""that guy.""  If it weren't for the cool factor of the huge screen and seeing a movie I've been waiting to see since childhood, I would have walked out in annoyance.  Seriously, what compels people to behave like this?  I don't know if this is due to the proximity to ASU (beefneck central), but it sucked.

-Previously mentioned by another reviewer, but Dippin Dots are awesome.  Simply awesome.

Getting out of the parking lot was a disaster.

"Amazing cheesesteak.

One mile from my home is Corleone's. About 15-20 minutes from my home is Capriotti's. I never go to Corleone's. I go to Capriotti's all the time.

The workers here are nice and the cheesesteak is terrific. The large is 20"" I believe, so if you're ordering for yourself and in no mood to eat until you have a stroke, get the medium. Also, try it with the hot peppers. It adds the slightest bit of spice without becoming too overwhelming.

That's really all I can say about this place. Wonderful cheesesteak. I haven't tried anything else because the cheesesteak is too good to pass up when I make the drive down there. The patrons rave about the other sandwiches, though, so I absolutely would not be afraid to try something else. There's maybe 5 or 6 tables inside and 2 outside? so be prepared to order to go if you arrive at prime dine-in lunch/dinner hours.

Do yourself a favor and go to Capriotti's. Help this place attain the reviews and ratings it deserves. The fact that there's only 8 reviews is criminal.

"This place is great to go in and have a look at the plethora of neat toys and candy they have... but that's about it. The prices are way too high and a lot of the items aren't things you can't get anywhere else. They also have a real lack of imported candies/chocolate which is something I would drop more money for. Be prepared to buy more than you wanted if you only have plastic - they have a minimum of $6 to use your card so I had to buy two sodas I didn't want in order to get my handful of candy.

We grabbed some brews and shared the patatas bravas (a personal favorite) and the mushroom appetizer.  The mushroom appetizer was heavy on the cheese but still a tasty bite.  The patatas bravas really never fail- they remind me of my Mom's version of french fries.

"I love Mexican food. Today I ate half of a taco and simply had to stop; not in a good way either. The meat tasted like it had been frozen multiple times and lacked flavor. The tortilla tasted like it was store bought and made of paper. The beans were flavorless. The rice was hard and lacked any flavor. Moving to the vegetables: shredded plastic is not actually a vegtable. This is some of the worst tasting, most over priced Mexican food I had had. It would be one thing if it was reasonably priced, but $10 for taco is a absurd amount for a worst than fast-food taste. 

The margarita was good, but $10 for a margarita is a bit on the high side.

The service was average, but I found it odd that my waitress didn't find it odd that only a bite of each item was missing and never asked how the food tasted.",love mexican food today ate half taco simpli stop good way either meat tast like frozen multipl time lack flavor tortilla tast like store bought made paper bean flavorless rice hard lack flavor move veget shred plastic actual vegtabl worst tast price mexican food would reason price taco absurd amount worst fast food tast margarita good margarita bit high side servic averag found odd waitress find odd bite miss never ask food tast,1

"I met some friends last night at Cadillac Ranch and this was my first time going. The space has a very odd layout, but there are two bars (one inside and one outside on the patio) and both have plenty of TVs to watch. There is also a very cliche mechanical bull, but unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) no one rode it while I was there.

Service at the bar was really good, but when our group moved to a table, service became spotty. We had two servers for our table of 11 and one would take a drink order or would be asked for something and then not deliver it or something would get missed...the two servers just didn't coordinate very well. Luckily we weren't in a hurry and were a pretty laid back group. I only ate the Cadillac salad (mixed greens, tomatoes, cheese and croutons) and it was a nice size for $7.95. However, and maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine, but I hate when restaurants put the dressing on for you! I prefer for it to come on the side, as it does in almost every single restaurant I have ever been to, so I can put on as much as I would like. I did try a few of my friend's fries and they were good...not oily and for fries, they were actually pretty light. As a note, for groups, they put an automatic 20% gratuity on the bill, not the standard 18% most other places do.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place as a lunch or dinner destination as I was not impressed by the menu or the entree prices which seemed on the high side for what they were. However the three stars I am giving Cadillac Ranch are for their happy hour:

$2 domestics
$3 imports
$3 Fat Tire bottles
$3 Flavored Smirnoff Vodka drinks
$3 Margaritas
$4 Rum (Captain Morgan)
$5 Vodka Martinis
$3.50 to $5ish select appetizers (there are about four or five)

I'm always happy when I can get Stella drafts for cheap. Also, according to the bartender, one of the margaritas they serve can only be purchased a maximum of 4 times by one person because it is so strong. One piece of advice: If you start at the bar and move to a table, close your tab at the bar even if they offer to transfer it to your table.

"I find it hilarious that someone would reference this place as being terrible,  compare it to (overpriced and bland) Humble Pie, and in the same breath say it was the best chili relleno you ever tasted.

 I can't vouch for the chicken tacos but most street tacos are nowhere near packed with meat. By definition they are usually very tiny with onions,some guacamole, a little cabbage, and some small cuts of meat.  I can say the tilapia tacos are tops(large filet on each) on the list of my girlfriend's quest for good fish tacos. I can say the pork nachos are the best I have had as the pork reminds me of Los Dos Molinos in a small way. The empanadas are excellent as well.

If you go for happy hour you can get two empanadas for 6 bucks. You can also get 2 large fish tacos for 6 bucks. Would you like some awesome tortilla soup? 4 bucks.
If you get the dinner version of the emapanadas with a large portion of some of the best rice and a side of black beans I think it sets you back about 11 bucks. I have also had the chili relleno and it is the best I have tasted as well leaving me to wonder with the single review you have for anything, why the venom?

I learned long ago to ask for what is recommended for before you order and if someone recommends a place try what they are harping about first. When I asked they said the chili relleno, pork, empanadas, and red sangrias. Guess how my dining experience went? Try ordering tacos from Los Dos Molinos and you will leave pissed. Order the green chili pork and you will drive 100 miles for it.

I do hope you give it another chance I have honestly never had anything sub par here in my 7 or so visits and they seriously could charge way more for quality than they do.  I agree that Main Ingredient is great also, that's why I took the time to write about it. 

But to reiterate:

11-13 dollar for most dinner items besides new york strip(on the list to try), is not pricey

happy hour has most items for 4-6$

street tacos are not bursting with meat

ask what is the best thing on the menu when you order some place then you can write it off all you want.

Humble Pie  was more pricey and not worth it, All it does is take up parking from a much better place next door. For a place with the reference to pizza in it's name you would think it would be better, it tasted like peter piper.

My biggest problem with MADCAP is the price of admission. $10! That's more than a new movie. Why should I pay $10 to see a movie that I could get on DVD for half the price? I know the money is going to a bigger cause - having a cool theatre in town - but I just wish it was cheaper. If it was $5 I think I would go a lot more. For $10 it has to be something I really want to see and after not being so impressed by the Chuck Jones things I'm a little wary.  There wasn't even a screen in the theatre - just a white wall.

"Steak, yes, but 2 other words first come to mind when reminiscing about Modern Steak: Retail Therapy.

No, I'm not talking about the fact that Modern Steak is conveniently (albeit awkwardly) located in Scottsdale's Fashion Square. Instead, I think back fondly on a delightful little cocktail -- Belvedere, Grand Marnier, strawberry, basil and lemon juice, served chilled in a martini glass (as expected), but also with a little carafe of extr drinky-drink (unexpected), complete with a suspended ice-ball to keep your drink cold while you sip -- without watering it down. GENIUS. 

Ok, ok, so you're wondering: why the 3 stars? Well, genius cocktails only get you so far. I like to think that I've sampled a fair number of steaks in my day, from frou-frou to straight-from-farm fresh, and I gotta say that the whole steak experience at Modern Steak was about a 3 -- not bad, but not amazing. Just pretty...average. And for $46, I'm not %100 convinced it was worth it. Let me elaborate:

 - 12 oz. filet: I ordered it three of their five sauces -- the Steak Sauce (which cost extra...bummer) and the House-Made Ketchup. Now, one of the sauces that I simply a-dore with a nice steak is a Peppercorn sauce...so I was a little bummed when they didn't have one. So after getting a recommendation for the Steak Sauce, I went with it, and it was...well, kind of a let down. I didn't love either sauce, truth be told. Granted, I haven't tried the other three, so I guess I'll have to go back and check them out, but all in all, my steak experience was lessened by these sauces, rather than heightened. Boo.

 - Sides: we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts and Yukon Gold Potato Puree. The sprouts were...meh, but I'm willing to admit that I've been spoiled by the best brussel sprouts of all time at a little place called Larchmont Grill in Los Feliz, CA. They are fantastic. But even so, I'm not convinced these were really that great...I felt they were a definite let down. As for the potatoes, they were literally SWIMMING in butter, which made them very difficult to eat...and to top it all off, both sides were pretty small, even for two people. 

All in all, I felt the level at which the meal was prepared was a bit sub-par considering the prices and what I can imagine they were going for...there are a lot of restaurants that do what they do, and do it a lot better, so if they want to compete, they're going to need to up their game. UP it.

"I'm writing this review with the benefit of being an experienced Kindle Fire user vs. someone brand new to the Kindle family. In summary, you are getting a great deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 500 or more you can spend on a Wi-Fi version of iPad. Overall, if you consider the price and the functionality I think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding. If you are a first-time large-screen tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration in comparison to more expensive versions, I'd recommend it. If you're comparing last year's HDX model to this version and it is operating fine, I'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.My review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the Fire HDX to last year's Fire HDX but also some of the features for a first-time user.Consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the Fire, setup took a while: despite being a brand new product, the Fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates. You just need to be patient while it downloads and installs.Screen Display / Video Playback:This version of the Fire has the best screen display of any previous model of Fire and looking at the technical specs Amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp in a side-by-side comparison to last years HDX version and my iPad Air (yes, the Kindle guy uses an iPad for work): I compared the viewing experience watching an episode of The Lost Ship.Read more",write review benefit experienc kindl fire user vs someon brand new kindl famili summari get great deal comput especi compar spend wi fi version ipad overal consid price function think great tool toy watch lot video play lot game video qualiti outstand first larg screen buyer price vs valu key consider comparison expens version recommend compar last year hdx model version oper fine say save money continu get money worth review compar lot featur version fire hdx last year fire hdx also featur first user consist experi setup previou model fire setup took despit brand new product fire attempt download instal sever oper softwar updat need patient download instal screen display video playback version fire best screen display previou model fire look technic spec made major chang display resolut pictur appear crisp side side comparison last year hdx version ipad air ye kindl guy use ipad work compar view experi watch episod lost ship,0

"Cowboy Ciao is one my favorite restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.  To start with, they share a wine list with Kazimierz.  My favorite menu item is the Stetson Chopped salad.

For dinner, I actually like the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  The tastes are really unique and I got to try mushrooms I hadn't had before.  It's great!

I did try the Bacon Peanut Brittle for dessert and I cannot recommend this.  It was not good at all.  It just makes the brittle really greasy and then you run into chunks of bacon...ick.

Today my co-worker and I actually waited an unbelievable 50 minutes for our food, which - if your waitress stops by, checks in with you, apologizes, lets you know she knows you've been waiting - wouldn't have been nearly so bad. Still extremely annoying, sure, but forgiveable. Not this waitress - we had to call her over for every thing we needed. Serioulsy, not once did she just stop by to check on us. We had to call her over to place our drink order, ask for sugar for our tea, to place our food order, to get the check, everything.

"Bottom line: Scott's has a matzo ball soup so good I can't imagine how anyone could ever hate the Jews. Best bagels in Phoenix, hands down. Take your Einstein's and shove it.
Scott's has an expansive menu that ranges across breakfast, traditional deli offerings, and a strong but semi random assortment of 'home cooking' type meals that your mom makes but you never see in restaurants. I haven't spent a lot of time in delis in New York, but Scott's reminds me of the ""New York deli"" I used to live around the corner from in Houston, down the street from the JCC - tasty, simple, and unapologetic, about anything. I love their soups, although their pastrami is not the best I've ever had. They have every flavor of Dr Brown's imaginable. The portions are huge - too huge, actually. I'm minuscule, so the prospect of a sandwich that is 3x what I can eat in one sitting is daunting to the point that I only go if I know I can take a box home.

"Out of all of the Flo's locations, this is the one I've frequented the most over the past 3 years of living in the Valley.  I've seen the menu change here and there, but I have to say, I've never had a bad meal at Flo's.

I met my friend Melanie H for dinner this evening and we really enjoyed our meal... we had great service - our waters stayed filled throughout the time we were there, and our food was served promptly. Our server checked on us several times as well.  We started with vegetable pot stickers and requested that they come steamed.  They were delicious! Next, we shared 'Indian Curry Vegetables' (I ordered it with shrimp) and Indian Vindaloo Chicken.  Both were extremely tasty - fresh veggies, chicken, and shrimp in really flavorful sauces with just the right amount of spice.  The curry vegetable dish came with broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, snow peas, and long beans.  The chicken dish had tomatoes and onions. We also had steamed white rice.

Note to Flo: We were both disappointed that you took the Vietnamese Spring Rolls off of the menu and I miss the days of the green curry dish with calamari. One more thing - the chicken corn soup that you serve at the DC Ranch location should be offered at the others as well - I love that soup!

Fortune cookies came along with the check and we both were happy with our fortunes.  The bill didn't break the bank either.

"So, not following my own advice (ahem, NEVER RETURN), I returned here for a friend's birthday dinner a few months ago (I super love this person so how could I say no?). HA! Big mistake. Also, fair warning: there are several-a-CAPS-LOCK ahead.

The only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group (15 people). And of course because we were celebrating a super special person.

I'll keep this update short and sweet:

$3 for a CAN OF SODA? Get real. I knew it'd be overpriced but I was at least expecting a mini bottle or something. But a can? COME ON. You bought that in bulk and paid .03342 cents for it. FAIL.

Your servers: IDIOTS. First it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders. Then she's back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again. Did you forget? Were you not paying attention the first time we around? Why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks? And on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO RECEIVE DRINKS IS BAD. Very, very bad. 

Also, not taking food orders until after we've been seated for ONE HOUR is BAD. VERY, VERY BAD. Seated at 8 o'clock, we didn't receive our food until almost TEN O'CLOCK. TWO HOURS FOR FOOD IS VERY, VERY BAD. Do you hear that, St. Francis? BAD.

Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner, and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil, I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer (and add on a $3 can soda). Funny, that our bill was still nearly $30 for the both of us. Excluding tip. BAD.

Also, server: If you say you're not going to split a check, stick to your word or don't even try. Now, I'M glad you didn't stick to your stingy ""I don't split checks"", because I could foresee the mess of trying to split a $700 bill with 13 people I didn't know so well. Lucky for us, when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check, you split it for us. A couple others caught on and did the same, but the remaining 7-8 people were not so lucky. 

Because I realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore (or sweet, for that matter), I'm ending it here.

"I'm going to break this down to explain my two stars. Here we go.

THE GOOD: 
* Great Sindhi biryani - the rice is flavorful, the chicken is tasty, all in all a great dish. 
* Chicken boti tikka (boneless pieces of marinated chicken grilled in a clay oven) - also tasty, but have had better elsewhere
* Naan - Really good stuff. Crisp and soft in all the right places - exactly how it should be made. Better than 95% of other Indo-Pakistani places in the Valley.

THE BAD:
* Chintzy interior which seemed like you just warped yourself straight back to the Punjab somewhere, complete with water-stained panels on the ceiling. 99.99% of the time, this doesn't faze me at all, but something was a little off and I don't know why.
* A surly ""aunty type"" who's standing behind the register and doesn't even want to greet you unless you're apparently related to her or go to school with her kids
* Said ""aunty type"" disappears into the kitchen for 5 minutes at a time, so you stand around and wait. And wait.
* Said ""aunty type"" expresses nonverbal displeasure when you ask her for anything. Case in point: Asking her for tamarind chutney. Even though you waited for your food for 30 minutes.
* Said ""aunty type"" brings back a tiny plastic cup of goopy, thick tamarind paste. Huh?
* Said ""aunty type"" doesn't say ""thank you"", smile, or anything when you go up to pay, even though you've been nothing but friendly and appreciative. So much for engaging a potential repeat customer. She could care less about your patronage.

THE UGLY:
* Big screen TV tuned to some badly acted Indian soap opera about some ancient king of Sri Lanka who tries to get it on with his handmaidens while his brother schemes for the throne while twisting one end of his moustache, but then switched to another channel showing bad, unknown songs from 4th-tier mid-90's Bollywood movies. Although I am not kidding you...there was one video where a guy and a girl were doing their running around and singing thing....in the SWISS ALPS. And then, all of a sudden, in the middle of all that snow, a table appears full of Indian food and an umbrella advertising beer and pretzels. WTF? 

So, in the end, here's the equation:

1 Pretty Good Food - 1 Dubious Dining Room - 1 Surly Aunty Type - 1 Singing/Shrieking Girl/Guy While Eating Curry On The Matterhorn Which Makes No Sense - 1 Overly Randy King of Ancient Sri Lanka Who No One Really Needs To See = 2 Stars.

"This was our second visit to Chelsea's Kitchen.  They have valet parking available, but there is lots of self parking in the same parking lot.  It's quicker just to self park.

We sat indoors both times.  When the weather is right, the outdoor patio is popular, but I prefer indoor seating.  It feels comfortable sitting inside.  The way the tables and booths are set up it feels comfortable, and not crowded.  The spacing is just right.  During peak times, there is a full bar inside to relax while you wait for a table.

We started with tuna tartare, guacamole and chips.  It was a good choice.  We also ordered some beer.  The beer choices were limited.  The table next to us had a pitcher of sangria ... that looked like the better choice.

For dinner we had the short rib tacos and the ahi tuna.  My son had the kids meal mac and cheese.  I've had the short rib tacos both times I've been here, and it's outstanding.  The braised meat is tender, and served with corn tortillas, beans, guac, tomatoes, etc.  All of our meals were good, but the short rib tacos were the best.

For dessert we shared the red velvet cake.  It comes with a small scoop of vanila ice cream.  It could have come with a little more ice cream.  The cake was moist and not too sweet.  It was gone in a minute.

"2 stars because I really did like the eye doctor I saw, she was awsome.  

Thought I was off to a good start getting new glasses.  I picked out my frames while I waited to be taken care of.  

Oh...wait...the eye glass gods had something else in store for me.  

The person helping me couldn't get an authorization code from my insurance company because it was afterhours.  He actually told me I had to pay full price or come back tomorrow.  Now keep in mind that I have had this insurance forever, never had any problems before; after hours, weekends, etc.  So I used my cell and called the insurance company.  I get someone on the phone who is trying to help us.  I put eyemaster guy on the phone and he actually got into a fight with the woman on the phone, handed it back to me and said here you talk to her, I'm done.  

So the lady got me the authorization code and a explaination that this doesn't happen because most eye glass providers can take care of everything in spite of the insurance company being closed and she also asked me if I was sure I shouldn't switch eyemaster locations due to this guys behavior.  

But I thought I was done.  I have my glasses picked out and I needed them to drive.  So while she was talking to me the guy at eyemasters was throwing out insults loud enough that the lady could hear.  

So I lost 1/2 hour of my time and think the worst is over

Well...those darn eye glass gods...I can't get them in an hour because it was too late in the day the guy tells me.  He has the right lens and it was only 6:00 pm,  come back tomorrow.  

So I called today and was told 1/2 hour and they will be ready.  I drive over there on my lunch hour and guess what.  They aren't even close to being ready.  So I walk around the mall, come back and guess what, only 1 pair is ready.  That would normally be ok but the attitude of the two guys working is arrogant and not very customer friendly.

"When Tempe Market place was being put together...I though WOW a swanky place where college kids and laid back adults could get together and enjoy themselves.

Nearly Drowned by the ample amount of misters.  Thought to self...hmm well at least the food should be good.  Ordered the sliders meal... maybe they were scarce on meat, but the slider patties were the size of silver dollars, tasty but small.  Yes the service was slow; my glass was getting refilled faster by the misters than the actual waiter. It gets two stars in my book for the service and the overall experience (for lunch that is). you get what you pay for..and for 11 bucks, a couple barbie sized patties in human size buns, a not so 'AHH' diet coke, and 5 oz of wine (and that's on the 2.00 happy hour deal) ... kind of seems appropriate.

Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look.

"I went in once looking for Canidae.  Which according to their website bold print they carry, but not the fine print.  They don't carry it in all of their stores.  My dog has food allergies so I'm cautious about changing her food quickly but since it was about 7 pm and I was pretty much out of food on this day, I figured some food would be better than no food.  

During my visit I learned many things.  Apparently Canidae is a inferior brand and ripped off its ingredients and packaging from Innova.  Innova is a far, far superior dog food.  Innova is awesome, Canidae is for chumps.  Innova is also more expensive and a smaller bag.  Nothing I couldn't afford but annoying none the less. Not wanting to create dog food controversy I bought a bag of the morally superior Innova.

But when I checked out I was asked about four times whether I realized I was buying nibbles instead of bits.  ""You know you have the nibbles. Are you sure you want nibbles?  We have bits if your dog prefers bits"".

She's a 70-lb lab that will eat anything except for vegetables.  I mentioned that the nibbles were fine.

Me: What the fuck, bitch. ""Uh, ok""

Dear Ra Waitress,

I'm sorry if I kept you or any other employess, especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed.  It was completely ok to rush me, even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine.  I was hardly the last customer in there.  There were people all around me ordering sushi, so I'm still unclear as to why you needed to rush me.  If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food?  Maybe it was because you don't know how to count, since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot.  I like Ra for the atmosphere, something you completely ruined.  Thanks for that.

Cool room - very hip compared to most anything else you're going to stay in..  Not quite a W but not your typically Sheraton either.  
Friendly staff
Had this really cool video input box on the desk connected to the TV.  Allowed me to plug my laptop video into the box and have it come up on the TV.  Was able to stream netflix easily to the TV.
They have a bar
Easy parking close to the door
Location drive-able to restaurants
Pool

Bed and pillows kinda like a futon.  
No formal restaurant.  
Funky frozen dinner/entries offering is more funky than useful to me and I travel a lot.

"Can I tell you how much I despised Fate with all its pretentious, snooty bullshit? I should have known the second I realized that Bliss/reBar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil.

And so it is. We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. There is no hostess or even a hint of one. We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? The place was dead.). We were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. Um, it's 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD. I guess we'll wait. We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. That's sure inviting, isn't it.

So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so I go with the veggie sandwich. That sounds innocuous enough, right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My ""veggie"" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was. 

Eggplant.

Ohhhhkay then. 

It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.

"I have been coming here since discovering them after their opening week last year and I haven't stopped coming back. The food is predominantly Filipino; the Filipino-Mexican fusion comes in the burritos, flautas and quesadillas filled with Filipino meat dishes. A great starter would be the Chicken Adobo burrito. Karey's does it right by not dumping rice and fillings inside the burrito; they're served on the side. 

For those more interested in rice plates and combinations, Karey's serves daily prepared dishes such as Pork Adobo and Chicken Adobo (pork or chicken simmered in garlic and soy vinaigrette) and Beef Mechado (a type of stew with beef chunks, potatoes, and onions in a light tomato gravy) with either white rice or Garlic Fried Rice (yummy). There are also specials that rotate each day, which can be checked out on their Twitter account. This is a great idea as one can find out when they are serving Lechon (roasted pig)! Yum!

There are dishes that can be prepared fresh but are not part of the combination specials.  The ones I've tried that I highly recommend are their Lumpia (fried eggrolls in chicken, beef, or vegetable) and Pancit Canton (stir-fried noodles with vegetables). The pork lumpia was great when they used to serve it, and I preferred it to the beef lumpia that they serve now...but it's still good ;)

Not only is the food delicious but the warmth of the staff is something to always look forward to. Karen and Rey make you feel truly at home.

"Set up a VinVillage event at this place, sight unseen, which I hosted last night. After the glowing descriptions on their website, some of the reviews here, and knowing they are located at CityNorth, I expected much better! 

Walking in, I did not get the feeling of ""upscale"" restaurant. Sports on 2 TVs blaring out over the bar and into the open dining room did nothing for the atmosphere. They had a long table pulled together for our group in the center of the room, but I grabbed a seat at the bar since I was the first to arrive. Took a few minutes, but the bartender eventually gave me a wine list/menu, answered my questions, and proceeded to get my drink. They had a good selection of wines, and some you don't normally find on wine lists at every other place in town.

A few others came in and we moved to the table, no problem transferring tabs. Seemed to take a long time between everyone (about 15 of us, though we initially expected 20) receiving their drinks and the time the first apps came out. Granted, they were complimentary (the deal I worked out for my group), and they were quite yummy - especially the spicy tuna on tempura eggplant - so once we started eating, we forgot about the wait. The pate was very rich and served with soft slices of raisin bread. Some were immediately addicted to the bacon-wrapped dates.

Everyone ordered a burger of one type or another, some opting for the pre-selected toppings, other customizing and adding sweet potato fries. We confirmed that everyone was on separate checks. My burger came out not quite as rare as I would have liked, but what do you expect when the patty is only 1/2"" thick? I am not a big beef fan, anyway. Sauces were good, especially the pungent garlic parm, as were the fries.

But then, we waited for the checks...and waited...and waited. Seems the staff didn't begin trying to sort out who had what until at least HALF AN HOUR AFTER everyone had finished eating and plates had been cleared! And none clearly knew how to use the POS system. Those who had cash eventually tired of waiting and just left it on the table. Those of us with credit cards were not so lucky...and several bills had to be re-rung, as they did not include the right items.

"Last night was my first adult play experience. I have been to the theater to see the Nutcracker when I was a kid and I saw the Lion King in New York when I was a kid as well. I remember them being fun, but that's about the extent of my memories of the theater. There happened to be a groupon for the play ""The Mystery of Irma Vep"" that my mom purchased for the four of us (mom, myself, husband, sister) to attend. 

We got there a bit early after dinner and walked around the theater looking at the art that was up around the building. There were places you could grab a drink and relax before the show. At our call time we went in and found our seats. We were up on the balcony in the fifth row pretty much right in the center. We had really good seats. The only thing about this theater that made me uncomfortable and keeps it from attaining that fifth star were first of all the seats. The backs were extremely straight and having a back condition it makes sitting up that straight difficult for long periods of time. The second thing that was a bit uncomfortable was the temperature of the theater. It was a bit warmer than I would have liked. I left coated in a film of sweat. Not pleasant. I was nervous I wasn't dressed appropriately having never been to the theater before, I went in jeans and a t-shirt, but I am glad now that I did because it would have been much more uncomfortable in one of my nice silk dresses than in jeans. 

However the show was hilarious. The part that made it for me was when one of the characters started singing the Rebecca Black ""Friday"" song. Classic! Most of the people in the theater didn't get the reference so there were only a few pockets of young people laughing when it happened. But I found it to be a nice touch and after a play full of references I didn't get, I liked that there was something for us young folk thrown in. The rest of the show was funny, and I am glad that I got to experience it. 

After coming here I am interested in becoming more active in plays and am looking into seeing a ballet soon. All of us really enjoyed this, and I was surprised my husband liked this as much as he did.

I ordered the red pepper tomato quiche. After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven, I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter. When I dug in for the first bite, a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche. I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche, and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served, because she was sure she got it right. The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit,  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send, ""well we don't have anymore of that one.""

Thanks. I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche.

"Pauli from ATL checking in here.... just for a bit of nostalgia...

I used to live in Phoenix a few years back, and of all the places I miss eating at, this is #1 on my list.  I remember how I first heard of the place.... I was over at a friend's house in Scottsdale having a few beers after work, and remember asking him what his favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix was.  My friend, who had more than just a few beers in him, stared at me all glassy-eyed, got right in my face and said... ""Cheeeeno Banddddeeedo!!""  As I backed up a bit, thinking my friend had too much to drink (he had, for sure), I wondered... hmmm...the Chinese Bandit?  What the hell is that place about?!?  Or is he just f***ing with me?  So, I asked him what kind of food they serve there... And, as he did his best to focus on me, when his eyes hit mine, there was this long pause.... and he had this expression on his face that I can't forget... I wasn't sure if he was having trouble putting it into words or if he was sh***ing in his pants.   And then he put his hands together, like a nutjob working a Rubik's cube.... and said, ""They... dooo... things... like.... egg-foooo youngggg burrritos and jaaaade red chicken tacossssss....""..... as he gave me another crazy-ass look (the kind that tells you it's time to say goodnight and get outta there - which I did)....

So, a few days later, I remembered his drunken explanation of Chino Bandido and thought I would go check the place out.... And from that point on, I was hooked.   Egg foo young burritos indeed!   And jerk fried rice!   And those refried black beans with fire-in-the-bungholio sauce mixed in.... Yep, those will burn you twice... All served in a giant disposable aluminum baking dish... And you got that combo, along with a soda and tip for about $10!!!   WOW!!

"Love this place! I went with my Grandma and Aunt on a Thursday afternoon. The weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside. First I like the layout of this place, very open and airy. There are 2 outside patios one street level and then one upstairs. I actually have been here twice so far. First time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists. The servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka, grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend. 
The second time we ordered 3 small plates to share, ahi tacos, artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels. All three were heavenly and very reasonably priced. The ahi was fresh and chilled, perfect for a warm day. The artichoke dip was different than any I have had before, gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl. The chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted, even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips. The mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves. Buttery and melt in your mouth good, not chewy at all with no grit, to most common problem I find. The broth was so good I let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl, soaking up the juice. My martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table. 
Now on to the staff, all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled. All of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server Jennifer. We also met one of the sous chefs, Lennie. A charming fellow with stunning blue eyes, my grandmother remarked on them, a playful Mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform. He swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket. I do believe he is right, cooked to perfection, slightly crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and I believe Parmesan cheese. After our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking.

"*cut to scene* Friday night, lounging around discussing the lameness of the evening, ready to indulge in a new adventure. six pack of Newcastle sits untouched in fridge and bellys aching for fulfillment. yelp.com search reveals a local japanese eatery nearby. 

enter, Hana.

first off, pre-game excitement for this BYOB, local, fresh sushi spot. Newcastle in hand, my friend and I strutted in here at around 8pm on a mildly warm Friday night. the place is jammed, and a couple parties stand around waiting for tables. great, a long wait. nope, two seats open at the bar. sat down, and our beer was immediately taken and put in a fridge to ensure it wouldn't lose any of it's remarkably smooth quality.  first beer is poured, and the excitement ensues. friendly and welcoming server devluges us in the specials, and unfortunately they were out of most of their fish as they have been for three weeks. toro and salmon were our options, so we went with a special for the night, the spider roll, and the vegas roll. also, edamame to start.

the food was superb. the edamame came spicy with a side of chili flakes and siracha for our never ending quest to burn the shit out of our mouths. a second round of newcastle was brought upon when our first was finished, and the sushi came shortly thereafter, looking like little pieces of art. both sets of rolls were enormous and came about 6 to a plate. the vegas roll was packed with cream cheese, avocado, and salmon. the special roll, the spider roll, was full of crispy soft shell crab and just enough spicy-ness for a much needed kick in the mouth. one dip in my wasabi/soy sauce concoction was more than enough.

our third and final beer was poured by an overly-anxious and over-stimulated, presumably newbie, bus boy. I had about 4 inches of head on my beer and my friend got hers spilled and nearly twice as much head.  he excellent waitress we had made up for this guys slips during the meal. the staff wished us a nice farewell on our way out, and I felt as though I had just left a very close friend's house. 

I will definitely be back with more six packs and good friends to share this little diamond in the rough with.",cut scene friday night loung around discuss lame even readi indulg new adventur six pack newcastl sit untouch fridg belli ach fulfil yelp com search reveal local japanes eateri nearbi enter hana first pre game excit byob local fresh sushi spot newcastl hand friend strut around pm mildli warm friday night place jam coupl parti stand around wait tabl great long wait nope two seat open bar sat beer immedi taken put fridg ensur lose remark smooth qualiti first beer pour excit ensu friendli welcom server devlug us special unfortun fish three week toro salmon option went special night spider roll vega roll also edamam start food superb edamam came spici side chili flake siracha never end quest burn shit mouth second round newcastl brought upon first finish sushi came shortli thereaft look like littl piec art set roll enorm came plate vega roll pack cream chees avocado salmon special roll spider roll full crispi soft shell crab enough spici ness much need kick mouth dip wasabi soy sauc concoct enough third final beer pour overli anxiou stimul presum newbi bu boy inch head beer friend got spill nearli twice much head excel waitress made guy slip meal staff wish us nice farewel way felt though left close friend hous definit back six pack good friend share littl diamond rough,0

The club is huge (140 acres).   There is a main range for members and the public.  Then, there are multiple other shooting areas for members only.   You can shoot out to 500 yards at this facility AND you can shoot any weapon.   The only restrictions appear to be on the allowable ammo.

"Fez completely deserves five stars but as a pescatarian (vegetarian plus fish, as much as I hate labeling how I eat) I had very limited options. My husband and I ate here on a rare trip to downtown Phoenix.  

The burgers sounded mouthwatering but unfortunately there wasn't a veggie burger substitute.  Many restaurants offer this and I really had my heart set on a sandwich. My husband ordered the Fez burger, a delectable combo of honey molasses BBQ, spiced pears, and lemon garlic aoli.  I was fairly jealous but my shrimp kisra (flat bread pizza) was obscenely good with lobster sauce, wilted spinach and parmesan cheese. We also split an order of garlic rosemary fries, which were delicious. 

I wish we would have saved room for dessert as the portions were huge and really two much for us to eat! Normally I take my leftovers to go but since we were out for several hours I didn't want to leave anything to waste. 

I'd definitely come back to Fez but I won't be putting it into regular rotation due to the lack of veggie friendly sandwiches and entrees.",fez complet deserv five star pescatarian vegetarian plu fish much hate label eat limit option husband ate rare trip downtown phoenix burger sound mouthwat unfortun veggi burger substitut mani restaur offer realli heart set sandwich husband order fez burger delect combo honey molass bbq spice pear lemon garlic aoli fairli jealou shrimp kisra flat bread pizza obscen good lobster sauc wilt spinach parmesan chees also split order garlic rosemari fri delici wish would save room dessert portion huge realli two much us eat normal take leftov go sinc sever hour want leav anyth wast definit come back fez put regular rotat due lack veggi friendli sandwich entre,0

I came in with a group of 4.  We stood up front for 5-10 minutes before waving someone down to be seated.  That was a mistake..

As we're waiting for a server to take our drink order, we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled, dirty plates that needed bussing, and people with impatient faces.  There was only 1-2 dedicated servers, and they completely ignored us.

We stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order, it was like being in the Twilight Zone.  After 30 minutes and flagging down 3 employees, we just walked out laughing, no one had even apologized for the wait, I'm not sure they even saw us leave!

"We were driving around Chandler area to find a decent place to eat and Mido Sushi caught our attention. ""Oh, Okay!"" - I thought and walked right in. We were greeted right away with a good waitress, but somehow I found her voice was really annoying!
The food came out after 10minutes and I was disappointed with the sashimi! It wasn't as fresh as I expected. The soy sauce tasted very weird and too salty. By far this is not the most decent sushi restaurant I've experienced.

"This place is as good as I'd heard.  We came here for a day-late birthday dinner for my middle daughter/Father's Day dinner for her husband.  She and his six-year old daughter ordered a Hawaiian style with pineapple and ham, he and I  got the Margherita Pizza with garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, fresh basil, mozzarella, and romano cheese.  Both were so delicious!  He also got some chicken wings which were tender and juicy and not spicy at all, dipped in either of two great sauces, ranch or marinara.  The pizza's were about $13 each for the larges.  I usually have no problem quitting after two slices but the  flavor squishing around in my mouth was so good I couldn't resist taking a third piece at this place. 

The decor was pretty and the service was great--the server checked back several times to see if we were doing okay or needed anything.

 I would definitely be a regular if I lived near here.  


On a side note, next door is the Aloha Kitchen which we had eaten at about a week ago and was also very good!

"Ok, I'm new to the whole Thai food thing, and I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy food, so take this review for what it is....

I was told by plenty of uber-Thai food fans that this place was the bee's knees, but I wasn't too impressed. i kept it pretty standard ordering just pad thai noodles with tofu and iced tea. the iced tea was killer (i find that at most thai places, what is it with the iced thai tea phenomenon??)

the flavor was pretty bland, i have to say. it was the right amount of spicy, but just still bland, no bueno. plus, for a thai place, they did not cook the tofu well, it was totally bland, too.

i was disappointed, but i will probably go one more time because you never know if you just catch a restaurant on an off day. it was super busy on a tuesday lunch hour, too, but we got in and out pretty quickly, so it's good for a work lunch.

***update 1/08
I'm glad I made that disclaimer in my original review, because I've been back three times (only for p/u) and it's now one of my top thai places. Maybe I was bitter because my editor took me there for my year review to tell me the paper couldn't afford more than 3 percent raise (on a reporter's salary, that's about 35 cents - you can imagine my bitterness). Hahahaha. I'm still not 100 percent a fan of their tofu, but the other entrees I've tried are not as bland as my OG visit.

It's a great spot to pick up even if I just walk in and order because, what I assume is the owner (a middle-aged Asian women who dresses professional), is SOOO nice and helpful* with the menu and there is a small bar (really small, like 4-5 seats) where I can order a draft and hang out for the 10-15 minutes it takes to make my order.

*definition of ""soooo nice and helpful"": She answered all our questions regarding level of spiciness and confusion over which entrees included noodles or rice patiently and with a smile; suggested one of the most delicious fried banana/ice cream desserts I've ever had; and, one time she realized we weren't finished with our beers when our tightly packaged food was place on the bar, so she spent five minutes undoing the tie to poke holes in the to-go boxes so the steam could escape and not make our food ""sweaty"". RIGHT ON!

that definitely earned them an extra star for service! so... more like 3 and half

"I went in yesterday for happy hour to have a birthday drink. I had the house margarita for $5.75. Actually I had two! They were good. I think I disappointed the bartender when I question him why his $7.25 Margarita he was pushing was supposedly so awesome. He claimed Cruz a local Tequila was the reason. I argued just because it's local doesn't make it good. LOL. 

The house Rita stands up alone, as a good traditional Rita on the rocks. Don't buy the hype, as I saw half the crowd not question it and accept the pricier one on special as the way to go. 

The place was busy. They were also hosting a MBA networking mixer just off the main bar. In addition to discounted beer at happy hour they also offered free food! I thought those days were gone but they kept a steady supply of warm chips, salsa, veggie tray, cold pinwheel wraps and one or two hot Mexican items (mini chimis, and bean & cheese nachos) coming. I was going to order a half price appetizer as part of my happy hour, but heck I went for the free food and was just fine. 

My sampling of the appetizers makes me wonder how good the menu was, so I peeked at it. It looks pretty basic but tasty. I think everything was $12 or less on the dinner menu. According to the sign outside lunch starts at $5.99.  It may be commercialized Mexican food but it's a step up from some places like Taco Bell and Baja Express for certain.

The staff seemed competent and to work rather well together. Even though it was busy the staff was calm and quick to serve, which is a good thing. They seem to recognize some customers as regular patrons which was also nice. 

The woman's room off the bar was fresh and clean in this madness as was the bar and all areas I could see.

Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.  
When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.

"Tucked in a quite plaza In Chandler AZ, is an un-assuming, little Thai restaurant with BIG flavor. Despite the lack-luster curb appeal from the outside, the inside is quaint and clean. 
Get things started with some spring rolls. The sauce isn't mind blowing, but those 6 dainty morsels of fried goodness have got some real flavors goin on. (especially when dipped in your curry)
I recommend their signature dish, ""Thai Basil,"" for those who haven't been here before. 
I prefer an extra spicy, KANG-DANG (red curry): Your choice of meat, simmered in coconut milk with bamboo shoots, bell pepper, broccoli, carrots, green beans and Thai basil, Served with jasmine rice.  

I will say, some menu items are hit and miss. So don't judge this place based on ONE dish you don't like. (You can find something you aren't going to like on every menu across the country).

On the strength of other Yelps, I had the gravlux with dill mashed potatoes and tomato basil salad. All excellent as others have said. I had broccoli and cole slaw as my other sides. The broccoli was tender without being overcooked and the slaw was a pleasant vinegar-based, not creamy, variety that complemented the rest of the food nicely. The food filled the plate without being overwhelming and I found room for one of the Beaver cookies, actually two large waffle-wafer cookies with a lightly flavored lemon cream between them. The cookies are kept in a chilled pastry case, probably because of the cream filling.

"We stumbled upon this little place in a worn strip mall by accident, but it ended up being a very happy accident. 

Yes, it is true that the decor will not be gracing the pages of fashion magazines anytime soon, but this is a clean, no-frills kind of place. There is also no point in coming here if you are pressed for time, because it is not fast food by any stretch of the imagination. Most importantly, the food is good. Really good. 

The menus must have changed since other reviewers visited, because there was no Arabic on the menu. Everything is in English. I had the falafel plate and my companion had the lamb shank and rice. Both meals came with a wonderful lentil soup that I have had at Fattoush many times- but this one was so much better. The falafel plate came with falafel of course, a questionable salad, pita that looked homemade, and some of the tastiest hummus i've ever had. It was a huge amount of food, but it was so good that I was compelled to order an extra side of hummus to go with the leftovers. The lamb was apparently very tasty also- i'm not much of a lamb fan, so I didn't try it. The accompanying rice was very tasty though- very complex with many different flavors, but none of them were overwhelming. 

At 7.99 for the falafel and 9.99 for the lamb plate, the prices are more than reasonable, especially when you consider that each entree can easily end up being two meals. 

I admit that I am partial to Middle-Eastern food and rarely meet a falafel that I dislike, but this was definitely one of the better examples of the cuisine in the metro Phoenix area. I will definitely be back, and maybe next time i'll try the chicken.",stumbl upon littl place worn strip mall accid end happi accid ye true decor grace page fashion magazin anytim soon clean frill kind place also point come press fast food stretch imagin importantli food good realli good menu must chang sinc review visit arab menu everyth english falafel plate companion lamb shank rice meal came wonder lentil soup fattoush mani time much better falafel plate came falafel cours question salad pita look homemad tastiest hummu ever huge amount food good compel order extra side hummu go leftov lamb appar tasti also much lamb fan tri accompani rice tasti though complex mani differ flavor none overwhelm falafel lamb plate price reason especi consid entre easili end two meal admit partial middl eastern food rare meet falafel dislik definit better exampl cuisin metro phoenix area definit back mayb next tri chicken,0
"I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.br /br /Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.br /br /One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed.

"Let me begin by telling you about my horribly debilitating fear of going to the dentist.  It's epic.  Weeks before an appointment I start having nightmares.  Thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat.  I require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning. The sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off.  Basically, every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years....

Enter Dr. Marcia Blazer.  I read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in Scottsdale.  I literally googled ""dentists for anxious patients"", and her name popped up.  Her website appeared too good to be true.  They offered nitris (plus), offered non invasive options for dental procedures (double plus), and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear.

I went in for my first visit (a cleaning and exam), and I was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel.  They were warm and friendly, and put me at ease immediately.  During the cleaning, my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapy,pointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline.  How happy was I when they used an air abrasion tool instead...felt like a cool stream of water on your teeth, and BAM, they're clean!  They were so calming, that when I was informed that I had 2 cavities, I didn't even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in.

Fast forward two weeks to my filling appointment.  I had requested nitris (hey, I was feeling better but still SUPER anxious), which they had all set up in the room for me when I walked in.  Now here's my favorite part.  As I sat in the chair, the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvd's and asked me what movie I would like to watch during the procedure...What?? So I picked a lighthearted comedy (50 First Dates).  I was then given noise eliminating headphones to use (goodbye horrible drilling sound), nitris (hello happy gas), and a few hand signals to recognize if I was supposed to open or close my mouth.  And we were off!  She didn't try to maintain conversation (soooo annoying when dentists do that), and before I knew it she was done and I was disappointed because my movie wasn't quite over!  I was even told that had my dentist not needed the room I was in for another patient, that I would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie!

I have had several interactions with this office since then (regarding billing and follow up), and every time it is a pleasure to deal with them.  I highly recommend this office to anyone!",let begin tell horribl debilit fear go dentist epic week appoint start nightmar think sit dental chair make break cold sweat requir nitri oxid simpl clean sound drill enough make want claw face basic everi visit worst experi ever past year enter dr marcia blazer onlin search local dentist scottsdal liter googl dentist anxiou patient name pop websit appear good true offer nitri plu offer non invas option dental procedur doubl plu offer staff use accomod healthi dose dental fear went first visit clean exam amaz comfort made feel warm friendli put eas immedi clean least favorit part alway scrapi pointi tortur stab plaqu gumlin happi use air abras tool instead felt like cool stream water teeth bam clean calm inform caviti even panic attack thought come fast forward two week fill appoint request nitri hey feel better still super anxiou set room walk favorit part sat chair assist brought two big box full dvd ask movi would like watch procedur pick lightheart comedi first date given nois elimin headphon goodby horribl drill sound nitri hello happi ga hand signal recogn suppos open close mouth tri maintain convers soooo annoy dentist knew done disappoint movi quit even told dentist need room anoth patient would welcom stay finish movi sever interact offic sinc regard bill follow everi pleasur deal highli recommend offic anyon,0

I have encountered several dubious shady sellers since I started on Shopee about 1+ months ago. These sellers give Shopee a bad name. 1st seller sent me a message claiming the item is out of stock but I noticed it is still available but at a higher price! 2nd seller also claim another product is out of stock but the item continues to be put up for sale on Shopee. Also 'big thick bath towel' turned out to be only a small thin face towel. Many of Shopee's sellers are unreliable.,encount sever dubiou shadi sinc start month ago give name st sent messag claim stock notic still avail higher price nd also claim anoth product stock continu put sale also big thick bath towel turn small thin face towel mani unreli,1
